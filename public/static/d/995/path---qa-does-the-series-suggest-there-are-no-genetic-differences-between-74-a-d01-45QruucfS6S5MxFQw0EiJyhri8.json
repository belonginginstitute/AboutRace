Populations are not all the same. You do find gene variants that occur in some populations and only rarely or not at all in other populations. But that's not the same thing as saying that you can define large groups of people, millions of them, by genetics. The problem is there's a whole spectrum of genetic variation, but we impose simplistic racial categories on this spectrum. We ought not to believe that because people are of the same race, they are genetically similar; within races there is a huge spectrum of genetic variation.</p>\n\n<p>We also have to think critically about what kinds of human groups we're comparing. Sometimes when we see statistically significant differences, we attribute it to race. But in any study, you're looking at a subpopulation within that race. A subpopulation might have something genetically interesting about it at a particular locus, but that doesn't necessarily tell you anything about the race writ large. It may mean that this particular subpopulation experienced some interesting historical event which shaped it in a certain way. An example of this is Tay-Sachs, which is a genetically inherited disease. People of northern European Jewish ancestry may be at higher risk because of something that happened to an ancestral population. So if you're descended from this ancestral population, you'll have that higher risk. If you include those people in the overall \"white\" population, it might look like there's a slightly elevated risk for white people to pass on Tay-Sachs, but it only appears that way because of an elevated risk within this one little subpopulation.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think it's so embedded in genetic research - that it inevitably happens. Research is done on whites from Washington, D.C. and they come to represent the white race without taking into account how much variation there is. I think a classic example are the studies that have been done on blacks in Brazil, which all of a sudden are interpreted as representing blacks in the United States and Africa as well. I think the Japanese are a great example of the confusion of \"race\" or even \"Japanese\" as being genetic. Two more examples that illustrate this point: Twenty years ago we thought of Japanese as an inherently short people. Now they're not. Twenty years ago we thought that they got a lot of stomach cancer but not breast cancer.

The more similar two species are, the more closely related they are by common descent. It's a bit more complicated with human populations because there's two ways that human populations can be similar to one another. Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow. Unfortunately, it's very hard to distinguish one pattern from the other. Are two populations similar by virtue of sharing common ancestry or genetic unions? The extraction of historical details from genetic patterns is actually a lot more difficult than it's generally represented in the media. Very commonly, different data sets will give you different narrative stories of origin. Different analysis of the same data, sometimes, will give you different stories as well. I know of genetic data that shows the New World was populated in one wave, in two waves, in three waves, and in more than three waves. So, I tend to be somewhat circumspect about taking historical narratives derived from genetic data at face value. This doesn't mean that you can't do it.

The more similar two species are, the more closely related they are by common descent. It's a bit more complicated with human populations because there's two ways that human populations can be similar to one another. Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow. Unfortunately, it's very hard to distinguish one pattern from the other. Are two populations similar by virtue of sharing common ancestry or genetic unions? The extraction of historical details from genetic patterns is actually a lot more difficult than it's generally represented in the media. Very commonly, different data sets will give you different narrative stories of origin. Different analysis of the same data, sometimes, will give you different stories as well.
