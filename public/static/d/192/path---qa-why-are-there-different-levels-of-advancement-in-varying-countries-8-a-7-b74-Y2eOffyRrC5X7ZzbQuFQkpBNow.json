The concepts of black and white, as we have them today, just simply didn't exist in the ancient world. These racial categories we're posing are fairly recent creations. In fact, the idea that there was a white race and a black race as such can be dated to the late 17th, early 18th century. So we don't know whether all these people who today would be considered black were actually considered black at the time, because we may be reading back our ideas of race as we've constructed them in the last two or three hundred years and to earlier times they really wouldn't apply.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>That brings up another part of the question that I was really amused by, actually, when I read it.
