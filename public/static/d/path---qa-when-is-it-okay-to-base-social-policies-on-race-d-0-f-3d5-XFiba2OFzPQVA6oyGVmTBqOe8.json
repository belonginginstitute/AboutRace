When is it okay to talk about race or use race? Isn't it just as wrong to base policies and laws on race today as it was 50 or even 100 years ago? How can you say that one use of race"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>I think the question presumes that we as a society cannot distinguish between really malignant forms of racial exclusion and policies that are designed to assist victims of that same exclusion. As Justice Stevens said in the Adarand case, it presumes that we can't tell the difference between a \"No Trespassing\" sign and a \"Welcome\" mat. For example, I think that the American public can understand that there is a significant difference between the many policies in trade unions that previously sought to exclude anyone but white Christian males and those policies and voluntary affirmative action programs in various trade unions today designed to rectify this history of exclusion. What is key is being able to connect the policy, such as affirmative action policy, to the past exclusions. Then you can see that the affirmative policy is merely a mode of undoing privilege and exclusion; i.e., a needed correction, and not a \"preference\" of any sort.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I don't think it's a coincidence that there's a movement to not consider race as a relevant category at this time in modern history. Especially in light of recent American history, when people of color have made a lot of progress to really push these issues into the forefront and demand recognition of basic civil rights and equal opportunity. I don't think it's accidental that there's this movement to erase the relevance of race. It certainly was relevant in the past. White people didn't have a problem with using and being invested in racial categories in the past. I think it's worth thinking about why they might be more invested in not taking \"race\" into consideration today.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Dalton Conley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"David Freund"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>One of the reasons it becomes very slippery to talk about race is because the concept - what it refers to and defines - changes over time. It often operates as a rationale after the fact for things that are ongoing. So this question is actually about how race has been used historically. One way to make it more concrete is to think about different historical uses at different times and to separate out the different dynamics and consequences that spring from each one. How does race operate after World War II, for example, versus after the Civil Rights Act, compared to how it operates today? Locating different uses of race in time and in a specific historical context is important.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-when-is-it-okay-to-base-social-policies-on-race-d0f","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhenIsItOkayToBaseSocialPoliciesOnRace","path":"/qa/when-is-it-okay-to-base-social-policies-on-race","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"f726db77-fe07-4633-8aa3-39a24b9aee89"},"updatedAt":1531332572327,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"f726db77-fe07-4633-8aa3-39a24b9aee89"}}
