Forty-two percent of the net worth of all households consists of equity in their homes - that means for most Americans, their homes are their single largest asset. Homeownership provides families with the means to invest in education, business opportunities, retirement and resources for the next generation.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>When the federal government stepped in to make it possible for most Americans to finance the purchase of their own home, they essentially paved the way for millions of average white Americans to begin their own wealth-building. But the policies they endorsed made it very difficult for minorities to attain the same resources and opportunities, resulting in deeply segregated communities and an enormous wealth gap between whites and nonwhites that persists to this day. In 1995, the median white family had over 8 times the net worth of the median Black family. The gap is even greater for Latinos - the median white household has over 12 times the wealth of the median Latino family.</p>\n\n<p>Race, wealth and life opportunities are intertwined in the United States. Today, white and nonwhite communities are still \"separate and unequal\" and the gap continues to grow, long after the Civil Rights era. Wealth, and the opportunities it affords, is passed down through successive generations. Along with it, Americans have also inherited a legacy of inequality that continues to shape the future. Segregation and the wealth gap between whites and nonwhites did not arise on their own. And because they are so deeply entrenched in the institutions that structure our society, they will not fade away by simply outlawing discriminatory policies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the state of segregation in the nation's metropolitan areas today?Â </strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S. population is more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Yet for the most part, America's neighborhoods remain highly segregated. The only areas that have become more integrated since 1970 are cities with small minority populations.</p>\n\n<p>On the whole, segregation is highest in the major metropolitan areas of the Midwest and Northeast and lower in the West and South.</p>\n\n<p>The 2000 census shows that overall the nation's largest cities have lost large numbers of white residents to suburban and outlying areas. The urban populace is becoming increasingly Latino and Asian, with a slight increase in Black residents.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Lewis Mumford Center at the University of Albany, segregation has increased in almost every large suburban area from 1990 to 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Across the nation, four out of five whites live outside of the cities and 86 percent of whites live in neighborhoods where minorities make up less than 1 percent of the population. In contrast, 70 percent of Blacks and Latinos live in the cities or inner-ring suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Census Bureau's 1999 American Housing Survey, 74 percent of suburban residents owned their own homes, while only about half of urban residents are homeowners. The proportion is similar when you compare homeowners by race - in 1999, 74 percent of whites were homeowners, while only 45 percent of Latinos, 46 percent of Blacks and 51 percent of Asians owned their homes.</p>\n\n<p>Whites are still the most segregated of all racial groups, have the largest suburban presence and are most likely to own their homes. African Americans continue to be highly segregated and as Latinos and Asians gain a larger share of the population, they are becoming increasingly segregated from whites as well.Â </p>\n\n<p>When whites relocated to the suburbs, their strong tax base and businesses followed. The result: a huge discrepancy in the quality and quantity of resources, jobs and public services in central cities and inner-ring suburbs inhabited by mostly minority populations. As white communities continue the trend of isolating themselves and their resources, the pattern of flight and divestment repeats, and the wealth gap grows larger.Â </p>\n\n<p>Communities cannot be expected to accomplish integrated, stable neighborhoods on their own. In a 2002 study by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, analysts found evidence of an overwhelming trend toward school district resegregation. Court-ordered busing once made Southern schools the most integrated in the country. However, when many of these programs expired in the 1990s, the proportion of Black students in majority-white schools decreased by 13 percent. Until the problem of residential seclusion is addressed, schools will continue to resegregate by default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But aren't some communities segregated by choice? What about the Chinatowns, Little Ethiopias and other ethnic enclaves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People sometimes assume that certain ethnic or racial groups segregate themselves \"voluntarily,\" but there are many factors involved. These groups often face discrimination when they try to enter established, primarily white communities. Limited job and economic opportunities, language barriers, and shared culture can also influence many groups to cluster. Ethnic enclaves, however, are very different from impoverished urban ghettos. Apart from \"first-settlement\" immigrant neighborhoods, rarely do ethnic groups ever become as highly concentrated as many Black communities. Ethnic groups can tap into various types of resources unavailable to areas of concentrated poverty: networks of friends and relatives, \"niche\" occupations and businesses, etc. Furthermore, ethnic enclaves are more transitory in nature - as stepping stones to entering more privileged, resource-rich communities. Still, many groups (such as Latinos and Asians) will face more barriers based on racial discrimination as they look to move out.Â </p>\n\n<p>Confronted with racially discriminatory policies, minorities could not take advantage of the programs that made it possible for millions of people to buy homes in the suburbs. People of color remained in the cities while they witnessed their white counterparts leave in droves. Today, mostly minority inner cities are characterized by the unique phenomenon of concentrated poverty. Inner-city residents face intense spatial isolation and inadequate public resources, education and economic opportunities. As more and more people leave, costs for basic services rise and the poor become even poorer. The average inner city consists of abandoned buildings, total business disinvestment, and resource-depleted schools leaving it vulnerable to violent crime, prostitution, and drugs. By the time anti-discriminatory laws were passed, suburban whites were enjoying soaring property values and minorities now faced the economic barriers that replaced those initially created by race.Â </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, after decades of segregation, a culture of poverty has become associated with people of color - particularly African Americans. Inner-city residents are not only surrounded by crime, drugs, homelessness and poverty, they are blamed for it. As john powell says, \"Not only have we racialized our space, but it is through space that we do our 'racing' in the 20th century.\"Â </p>\n\n<p><strong>How does discrimination, both past and present, continue to affect the life opportunities of nonwhites?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1992, The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released a study showing that Black and Latino mortgage applicants are 60 percent more likely to be turned down for loans than whites, even when they share similar employment and financial backgrounds.Â </p>\n\n<p>According to a 1998 report by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), African-American mortgage applicants were rejected 217 percent as often as whites - up from 206 percent in 1995. Latino applicants were denied 183 percent as often as whites - up from 169 percent in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>According to a Department of Housing and Urban Development study, high-cost loans are offered five times more often in Black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods. Furthermore, homeowners in upper-income Black neighborhoods were twice as likely to receive these sort of loans than homeowners in low-income white neighborhoods. In 1998, 9 percent of home loans in white neighborhoods were high cost compared to 51 percent of loans in Black neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Nonetheless, housing discrimination persists in subtler forms. Minorities still experience discrimination on an individual level as well as through a variety of systematic practices. Realtors who practice racial steering will direct nonwhites to segregated areas or direct whites away from integrated areas. Minority mortgage applicants who are regularly denied loans more often than their white socioeconomic equals will by necessity turn to predatory lenders who charge them higher-cost loans than their credit histories warrant.</p>\n\n<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced. Even if individual incidences of discrimination are no longer, the current housing market makes it almost impossible for a family with little or no assets to enter it. As home prices in resource-rich communities continue to rise, low to middle-income families must choose between renting or buying in at-risk, often segregated suburban communities.Â </p>\n\n<p>Ironically, defenders of the racial bias in the home lending system will point to the low net worth of minority applicants, even those with high incomes. As George Lipsitz points out, \"net worth is almost totally determined by past opportunities for asset accumulation, and therefore is the one figure most likely to reflect the history of discrimination.\"</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"53fbbef1-4d9c-4444-a8c2-6c86c95861c2","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2003, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Larry Adelman is Series Executive Producer of RACE -

It was a ranch house on a curving, leafy street in Merrick, Long Island, 25 miles east of Manhattan, about five miles from its more famous suburban neighbor, Levittown.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>After turning 65, my father wasted no time retiring. He'd purchased our house back in 1952 for $20,000 thanks to a 4 percent mortgage made possible by the Veterans Administration. Now he was considering an offer of $300,000. With the money they'd get a place in the Berkshires and winter in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years later, my colleague here at California Newsreel, Cornelius, sold the house he grew up in. Cornelius' folks had also purchased a place in the early '50s in Chester, just outside Philadelphia. A few years ago, after Cornelius' father passed away, his mother wanted to move back to Virginia. Cornelius sold the home in 2000 - for $29,500.</p>\n\n<p>That $270,500 gap reveals a microcosm of race in America. My family is white and Cornelius' is black.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court finally issued its ruling on whether the University of Michigan should jettison its affirmative action program. The court upheld the law school program that sought a \"critical mass\" of minorities but struck down a \"point system\" used to increase affirmative action for undergraduates. While the decisions didn't fully satisfy advocates on either side, on balance they were less \"anti-affirmative action\" than feared. I wonder how many justices had experiences like mine.</p>\n\n<p>Cornelius and I have worked together for 20 years, always making an identical salary, yet my net worth is several times his. My two brothers and I enjoyed good schools, parks and libraries because of rising property values. My parents' growing home equity not only provided for their retirement but sent the three of us to private colleges - and even helped with the down-payments on our own homes. Today, thanks to them, my house is paid off and my 21-year-old daughter is about to graduate college with a nest egg of her own. When my parents pass away, we stand to inherit a tidy sum.</p>\n\n<p>Cornelius had no such help. As American manufacturing declined, Chester became increasingly black and populated by people on fixed incomes, who faced higher taxes to maintain public services and schools. Cornelius' parents' expenses climbed as their city deteriorated. Cornelius attended college on scholarship, but worked his way through school. Today, rather than look to his mother for financial help, Cornelius helps support her.</p>\n\n<p>What's this got to with race? It goes back to the postwar suburbs and the government policies and subsidies that made them possible -- and guaranteed they'd be segregated.</p>\n\n<p>A set of New Deal programs led by the Federal Housing Administration allowed millions of average white Americans to own a home for the first time. Down payment requirements were reduced from as much as 50 percent to 10 or 20 percent and the time to pay off the remaining mortgage was extended from five years to 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>Federal investigators evaluated 239 regions for risk. Communities with a mere one or two black families were deemed ipso facto financial risks ineligible for low cost home loans. Government appraisal maps colored those communities red -- hence the origin of the term \"redlining.\"</p>\n\n<p>Between 1934 and 1962, the federal government backed $120 billion of home loans; more than 98 percent went to whites. Of the 350,000 new homes built with federal support here in Northern California between 1946 and 1960, fewer than 100 went to African Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Barred from purchasing a home in the new post-War suburbs, Cornelius' parents had to buy in one of the few communities where black people could live.</p>\n\n<p>Today, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the typical white family has ten times the net worth of the typical black family (nine times the net worth of the typical Latino family). Even when they make the same income, white families have over twice the wealth. Much of that gap is due to home equity and family inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>Many whites who grew up middle class in the suburbs like to think we got where we are today on merit - hard work, intelligence, pluck and maybe a little luck. We wonder why non-white parents didn't just work hard, buy a home and pass on the appreciated value like our parents did. We tend to be blind to how the playing field has been - and continues to be - tilted to our advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people. Those advantages are passed on and accumulate, generation to generation, giving us a head start in life. As Ohio State University law professor john a. powell observes: \"The slick thing about whiteness is that whites are getting the spoils of a racist system without themselves being personally racist.\"</p>\n\n<p>I sit on my back deck today, enjoying the blooms of the wisteria and reading an e-mail from my daughter about her post-college plans. My daughter certainly had nothing to do with slavery or Jim Crow. But the past still helps shape her future thanks to the many advantages my parents, me, and now she have accrued thanks to generations of racial preferences -- for white people.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"title":"Victoria Robinson shares how she uses her favorite clip on redlining in her teaching","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/280782466","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4580576fe9e74f76d3dae0589b93547e-ef1f6d2046a823c9596262bed16a9fda.png"}}}},{"title":"When the white residents of Eight Mile Road in Detroit were told they were too close to a Black neighborhood to qualify for a positive FHA rating, they built this six foot wall...

If you want to know your net worth, just add up everything you own, subtract all your debts and that's your net worth.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the average Black family has only one-eighth the net worth or assets of the average white family. That difference has seemingly grown since the 1960s, since the Civil Rights triumphs, and is not explained by other factors like education, earnings rates or savings rates. It is really the legacy of racial inequality from generations past. No other measure captures the legacy - the cumulative disadvantage of race for minorities or cumulative advantage of race for whites - than net worth or wealth.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth gaps between blacks and whites aren't explained by income. In fact, if you compare people at the bottom of the income distribution - say, a family that makes around $15,000 a year, you'll find that the average black family that earns $15,000 year in income has $0 net worth, or is in debt actually. Compare that with the average white family that earns $15,000 a year, and they have a good $10,000 to $15,000 in equity. That means being poor, being at the bottom of the income distribution, really means two different things depending on whether you are black or white.</p>\n\n<p>That white family has a little bit of a cushion. If unemployment strikes, as it does so often to people at the bottom of the economic distribution, they've got some means to ride out the storm. They might have a car that will increase the radius of their job search. They might have this money that they can spend in case of a medical emergency, even if they don't have health insurance. But compare that to the situation for a poor black family with $0 or negative net worth. There is no cushion. There is nothing in between the paycheck and homelessness, so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>The same kind of disparity emerges at the upper end of the income distribution. If you compare, say, a white family that earns $50,000 with an African American family that earns $50,000, you'll find that the white family has about double the net worth - about $80,000 to $100,000 of net worth compared to about $40,000 to $50,000 of net worth for the African American family at that income level. So when you are talking about the difference between financing their kid's college education, starting a new business, moving if they need to move for a better job opportunity - having $100,000 versus $50,000 in net worth might make the difference between upward mobility and stagnation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do other groups compare in terms of wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Blacks and whites really anchor the ends of the distribution in terms of wealth in America. Latinos fall somewhere in the middle. They fall, on average, closer to the African American average in terms of wealth. But there is enormous disparity within the Latino community. It's hard to talk about Latinos as a unified group because there are enormous differences within that community. And not coincidentally, how Hispanics fare depends on their skin color and it also depends on the particular history of that group.</p>\n\n<p>Cuban Americans, for example, have wealth levels that are much more similar to whites. They don't exactly equal the white levels, but they come close. On the other hand, Puerto Ricans or Dominicans are almost equivalent to the black average. Other groups, like Mexicans and South Americans, fall closer to that group, but again are in the middle somewhere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you define whiteness?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Defining whiteness is really difficult because it is a default category. It's something that we don't define. And part of whiteness is the fact that whites don't have to think about race. In the introductory sociology class I teach, I do an experiment with my students. On the first day of class, I ask them to write down five characteristics to describe themselves. And then I don't make any mention of it. Eight weeks later, when we get to race and ethnicity in the course, I ask them, okay, turn back to your first page, and tell me what you wrote down. I can predict almost to a person that racial minorities in the crowd will have put their race at or near the top of the list, while the whites in the group, except for a couple of troublemakers, don't have it on the list. They might put Polish or Italian or Irish - some sort of national origin up there on the list. But they don't put white or Caucasian or Euro-American.</p>\n\n<p>Ethnicity might matter but race doesn't matter to white people. And that is part of what whiteness is. It's not having to think about being in the norm or dominant group. Beyond that, it is also a sense of privilege, a sense that this society is stacked in your favor and you can do anything, because the American society, the American economy, is sort of like a banquet and you can keep going up for more helpings. That is your system. It belongs to you. So there is a sense of entitlement that comes with whiteness as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's an example of white privilege?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In trying to understand the power and privilege of whiteness, I like to get whites to ask themselves, how did I get my job? That is a good question to start with. Because very few people get their job in some formal way, where they see an ad in the paper, and then go apply, get an interview and then get the job. Mostly, people get their jobs through social networks and connections. Usually it's someone you know - your uncle in the next city or a friend of a friend who knows somebody in your industry. And that is how we get the foot in the door.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, because most jobs in businesses are controlled or owned by whites, given the structure of ownership in America, that leads to the perpetuation of racial inequality in the labor market. Whites tend to hire whites because they get them through their personal networks, which tend to be white. Minorities who aren't as directly connected to the people who are owning and controlling jobs are left out of this. And of course, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in a vicious circle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does wealth affect life outcomes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The single largest item in most people's nest egg is the family home. That has enormous consequences for the next generation. It means, for example, that if you own your home and have significant equity, you're in a high-property tax district, and you're going to a good, well-funded public school.</p>\n\n<p>It means that when it's time to go to college, if you don't have money in the bank, you can always take a second mortgage and draw off the equity in your home to finance your kids' college education. It means that you're in a neighborhood, most likely in the suburbs, where jobs are on the increase, and not in the inner city where jobs are on the decrease.</p>\n\n<p>It means that you're in a neighborhood where your neighbors control information and access to jobs. So you're getting the cultural aspects by virtue of living in a high property value area and you can get your kids better job connections. It means that if you want to finance your kids' job search after school, you'll have equity to support them for a while.</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few of the ways that having wealth, or owning a home, has enormous consequences for the next generation, not to mention one's own old age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does home ownership help you accumulate wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is this tendency for white Americans to see the structure of their aid in the form of tax credits and not as aid, or government assistance, or welfare. But they see other forms of assistance, like reduced rents or welfare benefits, as a direct handout from Big Brother.</p>\n\n<p>Owning your home, first of all, gets you a big mortgage deduction. That means you pay less income tax than you would be paying if you were renting and making similar monthly payments. Second, it probably places you in a community that has higher property values than one where you were just renting. Owner-occupied communities tend to be valued more, and that means that the property tax base is higher. That means that local services, everything from garbage services on up to the public school system, most importantly, are going to be better off in that community. So, without even having to spend your equity in your home, you are getting benefits from it.</p>\n\n<p>Third, there is the ability to borrow off that equity. You can finance starting up a business by taking a second mortgage. You can pay for your kids to go to college through a second mortgage. You can finance your retirement by selling your home. Since homes have increased so much in value over the course of the latter half of the 20th century, people can finance their retirements through the sale of their home and the capital gains they get from it. The home has been a central part of savings for most American families in the latter half of the 20th century. White Americans that is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What role did the government play in shaping housing and wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The American government provided low-interest loans to returning veterans and other white Americans after World War II. This created a boom in home ownership and helped suburbanize America, but blacks were excluded from participating. At this same time, the government was building high-rise public housing for minorities in inner cities. The segregation in America between a largely dark inner city and a largely white suburban community is not something that just magically happened from market forces. It is part and parcel government policy.</p>\n\n<p>When the government instituted rental housing in inner cities, in the form of public housing projects, for poor minorities, and then developed home ownership in low-cost, suburban communities for low-income whites, where you could put almost nothing down, they created this incredible wealth gap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does housing have to do with wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Where one's family lives in America is not just a matter of taste and preference. It has important consequences for the perpetuation of advantage or disadvantage across generations for a lot of reasons. First, you have the issue of housing and wealth. The majority of Americans hold most of their wealth in the form of home equity. So, that is their nest egg. It is their savings bank. They are living in their savings bank.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, the way that we finance education in America public schools is based on local property taxes. This means even if you never cash in the value of your home, just living in a high property value district or a rental and low property value district is going to affect what kind of school your kids go to.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, there are lawsuits in various states against this way of financing, where school funding is based on local property taxes. But still, it's the dominant form. We pay for our schools locally based on property taxes. So, in high value neighborhoods, which are predominantly white, you are getting well-funded schools. And in low-value neighborhoods, which tend to be predominantly minority, you are getting inadequately funded schools.</p>\n\n<p>The constraints that minorities face in the housing market doesn't just affect quality of life issues, you know, and the selection of homes and styles that people can live in. It really has enormous consequences for economic stability and upward mobility and the life chances of the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>Because minorities have faced limited housing options in the past, now they are usually confined to areas that have worse environment conditions, have poor school funding, have increased risk of violent crime, have worse tax bases. Plus their homes have less equity value, so even if they want to move, they are less able to afford to. Therefore the whole economic structure of the next generation can be really readily viewed in the limited housing selections of the previous generation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Didn't the civil rights era fix everything?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s really marks both an opportunity and a new danger in terms of racial relations in America. On the one hand, the Civil Rights era officially ended inequality of opportunity. It officially ended de jure legal inequality, so it was no longer legal for employers, for landlords, or for any public institution or accommodations to discriminate based on race. At the same time, those civil rights triumphs did nothing to address the underlying economic and social inequalities that had already been in place because of hundreds of years of inequality.</p>\n\n<p>The danger lies in the fact that many white Americans see the civil rights changes as having solved or addressed the racial problem, because it addresses the rules of the game. And many minorities recognize that because the starting line is so different for whites and blacks, it is almost irrelevant that the rules of the game were altered to be more fair. You really have this danger, where there is a complacency about issues of inequality, because we have addressed the official forms of segregation and discrimination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you mean by equality?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's more than one kind of equality. One is equality of opportunity, which means that as long as the rules are the same for everybody, then there is fairness. The motivation for the civil rights movement was really based on achieving equality of opportunity, and this notion of a colorblind society is based on that.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the rules are often bent, if not broken, and you can't talk about having a fair shot in the game if the starting line is staggered. Even if the rules of the game are fair, some people have advantages and some people have handicaps depending on the social position of the families they are born into and what kind of wealth they have, based on past opportunities. This brings us to the second type of equality, and that is equality of condition, which is a more progressive or radical form of equality that doesn't just look at the rules but where everyone is starting from.</p>\n\n<p>The notion of a colorblind society is really based on a mythology - the idea that as long as the rules are fair, we'll have equality. This doesn't recognize the fact that the rewards, the house, the Lexus, you know, the big bank account, those are not only the rewards, the pot of gold at the end of the game, they are also the starting position for the next generation. Until we recognize that there is really no way to talk about equality of opportunity without talking about equality of condition, then we are stuck with this paradoxical idea of a colorblind society in a society that is totally unequal by color.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the wealth gap come about?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's a lot of reasons why there are enormous wealth gaps between minorities and whites in America. The most simple answer is, it takes money to make money. Part of the reason that there's this enormous gap is because whites have long had higher wages and wealth to pass on from generation to generation. And it's like a snowball - it gets bigger and bigger as it gets passed on, and the interest gets compounded. That's partly the reason why the wealth gap has actually increased since the 1960s, since the civil rights times.</p>\n\n<p>But that's not the whole story. There's a long history of exclusion of minorities from wealth accumulation in America, going back to right after the Civil War.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, during slavery, slaves were forbidden legally in most cases from owning anything, including their own bodies. After the Civil War, Jim Crow laws instituted policies such as the Black Codes, which required black entrepreneurs to pay, for example, a $100 licensing fee but required whites to pay nothing. Back in 1870, $100 was basically like a million dollars today. It would shut people out of business. So blacks in the 19th century through that mechanism, and through pure terror, threats of lynching, were precluded from becoming business owners, as one example.</p>\n\n<p>By the 20th century, you had the institution of redlining as a policy in which banks rated neighborhoods for loans based on a four-tier system, red being the lowest ranking that a neighborhood could get. And African American neighborhoods were invariably given this red circle around them, and no loans from private banks would go into that system. That was a policy that was initiated by the federal government and adopted by private lenders.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to the New Deal, when Roosevelt really cut a devil's deal with white southern senators. He didn't overtly exclude blacks from Social Security, but subtly did it by excluding agricultural workers and domestic workers, who were predominantly minorities, from receiving Social Security benefits. This was done explicitly to appease southern Senators, to exclude African Americans, who were disproportionately employed in those two sectors. It wasn't until the Truman Administration that that got corrected. But there's a whole generation of elderly African Americans that didn't receive Social Security benefits, when in fact, it was the biggest giveaway of all, because no one had paid into the system yet.</p>\n\n<p>So you had whites receiving this sort of windfall, and blacks not getting it. More poor black elderly not receiving Social Security means that working families in the African American community have to support them and pay for it. So it's not only an issue of that generation. It trickles down through issues of inheritance and having to support the aged.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward again to after World War II when you have two separate American housing policies. You have this really pro home ownership policy where the government guaranteed low-interest loans for whites in suburban America and helped them obtain wealth. And for minorities you get rental, large-scale, inner-city public housing, which of course is a wealth destruction policy.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1960s there were occasional efforts to foster minority asset accumulation, but they really focused on things like financial skills, and community benefit which was, by definition, nonprofit. These efforts really didn't focus on rectifying the enormous wealth inequalities that had grown up to that point.</p>\n\n<p>Until we correct the fundamental wealth inequalities, these little programs of financial education and other sorts of cultural issues aren't going to make much of a difference, because the underlying economic structure is still unequal.</p>\n\n<p>I also would like to mention, by the way, that savings rates are the same for blacks and whites. That's a common stereotype, you know, of why these gaps exist - the idea that white people save more. And the data show that's simply not true.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But aren't there cultural factors that affect performance and have nothing to do with wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many social observers point to outcome differences between blacks and whites, say in education, where the college graduation rate for whites is double that of blacks. Or in occupational achievement, where whites are twice as likely to have a white collar or managerial job as blacks. Or in income, where white family income is on average about double that of the African-American unit. Or family structure, where whites are much more likely than African Americans to delay childbearing past their teenage years and until marriage. In almost any realm of life you can think of, there are racial disparities.</p>\n\n<p>Often when policymakers or social scientists want to compare the outcomes between black and white kids, they'll look at kids who come from families with the same income level. And when you make that comparison, you'll find that there's still a racial gap. People often point to this as something cultural or innate.</p>\n\n<p>But often when we're talking about these racial disparities, we're comparing apples and oranges, because there's still an enormous wealth gap between those families with the same income level.</p>\n\n<p>And I find that when you make the right comparison - when you compare a black kid from a family with the same income and wealth level as the white kid from the similar economic situation - rates of college graduation are the same; rates of employment and work hours are the same; rates of welfare usage are the same.</p>\n\n<p>So when we're talking about race in terms of a cultural accounting of these differences or a genetic accounting of these differences, we're really missing the picture, because we're making the wrong comparison. We're not comparing blacks and whites on an equal footing if we don't take into consideration these wealth differences in addition to the income differences.</p>\n\n<p>So a lot of times when we're talking about race it's really indirectly race. It's that race is associated with these vast income and wealth differences. And that's what's driving these seemingly cultural or behavioral differences in the next generation. The real issue is inequality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don't we just replace race with class then?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the post Civil Rights era it's very difficult to talk about race and class as two separate entities, because they overlap so much in our society. Many things that we associate with race on the surface, like differences in savings rates or differences in education and performance, are really class differences when you get the data and compare individuals coming from similar economic circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>But the complicating factor is that those very economic circumstances are determined by race, through historical inequalities; through contemporary dynamics where whites get jobs disproportionately more than blacks do and other minority groups. So race matters, but it often matters indirectly through the class position, the economic situation of a family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does past wealth help the future generation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As individuals, we like to think that our property is a result of our talent, hard work or even luck - that it's our individual fruits of labor. But economists have shown that about 50-80% of our lifetime wealth accumulation is really attributable, in one way or another, to past generations.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance actually plays a small role in that. What's more common is something like your parents financing your college education, supporting you while you're in school or taking care of you, letting you live with them, while you're looking for a job. It's also little gifts along the way, co-signing the loan for a mortgage, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n<p>All those kind of things lead to lifetime wealth accumulation. And it's this enormous debt we have to our ancestors' wealth that largely explains the perpetuation - in addition to discrimination and government policies - of racial equality in wealth over generations.</p>\n\n<p>So a lot of our wealth comes from our ancestors. Since whites have wealth in their family histories to a disproportionate amount, they're able to confer wealth upon their descendants, and this reproduces racial inequality.</p>\n\n<p>Blacks, on the other hand, tend to have not had wealth accumulation in the past generations for a variety of reasons. But whatever those reasons, even if the current generation makes a lot of money - because there's not also the past wealth to pass on, this racial inequity in wealth gets reproduced generation after generation, and maybe in fact gets worse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the housing market continue to perpetuate disparity?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The housing market is a place where culture meets economics - where values about what people want and where they want to live actually influence prices. Whites control the market by virtue of pure numbers, being the largest group. So when whites want to live somewhere, prices go up, and when whites don't want to live somewhere, prices go down.</p>\n\n<p>If you compare housing in black and white neighborhoods that's otherwise exactly equal - the quality of the housing is the same, the income level of the residents is the same, education system is the same, almost everything is the same - you'll find that the white housing will be worth more precisely because it's white. Because whites are the biggest group in the marketplace, their preferences count the most in terms of supply and demand. So wherever whites want to live, housing values will be high.</p>\n\n<p>The flip side is that if whites don't want to live somewhere, the value of houses in that neighborhood will be less. Think about it: if you have a group that makes up 12-14% of the population like African Americans do - or even 25% of the population if you take the entire non-white population of the United States - they can't compare with the demand created by the other 75-80% of the population, so houses in neighborhoods where whites don't want to live will be depressed by virtue of supply and demand.</p>\n\n<p>The evidence shows that even if a house is in exactly the same condition - it's been kept up at the same rate, the neighborhood is almost exactly the same, but it's black racially - it's going to be worth less money than a similar situated white neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>At one time we had explicit legal racial covenants and/or redlining policies on the part of banks. Today we don't need those anymore, because once we've segregated the market, it becomes in whites' interest to perpetuate the divisions. Whites get a boost in their property values by maintaining a segregation of the marketplace, maintaining their position as the dominant group in the housing market. So once you sort of have the initial push of racial covenants or redlining or any other policy that segregated the housing market, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy after that.</p>\n\n<p>And in fact, there's a vicious cycle here. Because when a neighborhood, a previously white neighborhood starts to integrate, even if individual whites don't have personal or psychological animosity or racial hatred, they still have an economic incentive to leave. Because they recognize that others might make the same calculation and leave first.</p>\n\n<p>And therefore, if there's a rash of selling by whites, which are the biggest group in the marketplace, prices will go down, by virtue of the laws of supply and demand. So you get a vicious circle where whites calculate that other whites are going to sell when the neighborhood integrates. Therefore, they want to sell first to avoid losses, and they actually make it happen - they make white flight happen and drive down property values when the neighborhood becomes more integrated.</p>\n\n<p>It's obviously disadvantageous to African Americans who want to accumulate equity in integrated or in predominantly black neighborhoods. But people don't talk about how it's advantageous to whites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's in it for whites?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The strongest argument you can make to white people is that the current system is not in their own interest, in the long run. The fact is that homeowners and people who have a stake in the American dream are better citizens. So when you systematically shut out a group from wealth ownership, from their slice of the American pie, you're creating an unstable and dangerous situation. You're inviting civil unrest. You're inviting crime. You're inviting a situation where there's incredible tension.</p>\n\n<p>When you have an inclusive society, a republic of property owners where everyone has the opportunity and reality of owning, then you create a stable society where people care about their communities and have a stake in their future. And it's in everybody's interest for everybody in America to have a stake in the future in terms of asset accumulation and economic self-sufficiency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can we do to remedy the wealth gap?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If we want to seriously address the issue of racial inequality in general and wealth inequality in particular, it's going to take dramatic, progressive action. Simply guaranteeing equal access to financial institutions and to housing markets isn't good enough anymore. There's just too much wealth inequality already built up, that the playing field is not level, no matter what you do to the rules of the game.</p>\n\n<p>Of course the most direct way to fix the black/white wealth gap would be reparations - a simple payment of wealth from whites to blacks. That's the most direct, racially explicit way - but probably also the least likely to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Another way is to take redistribute wealth not based on race but in a way that has enormous race effects. Say taxing the wealth of the rich and redistributing it through direct payments or matching savings plans to the wealth poor. It's going to take something along those lines to correct this racial inequity. Just simple equal opportunity won't do it at this point.</p>\n\n<p>I don't expect wealth redistribution to be popular. But it's already going on all the time. It went on in the 1940s and 1950s when we essentially gave away lots of equity in the form of suburban homes to white Americans. It's going on today through all sorts of mortgage interest deductions and corporate giveaways.</p>\n\n<p>It's happening all around us. It's just we don't want to recognize those, because they're benefiting the majority or dominant group of Americans. If we talk about something explicitly to benefit a minority of Americans, people have a lot more problems with that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should whites today be held accountable for things that happened in the past?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Often whites who resist wealth redistribution make the point that, well, my ancestors didn't own slaves; no one in my family was on a plantation, so I'm not responsible for the crimes of history. But the problem with that rationale is it ignores the fact that we're all interconnected and we're all inheritors of the past.</p>\n\n<p>If my family arrived here in the 1920s or the 1960s and is white, I've still benefited from the legacy of slavery. Slavery was the initial push that got the ball rolling and helped generate racial segregation, wealth inequity, inequity in job networks, inequity in housing markets, and so on. The legacy of slavery lives on, because those unequal conditions are still in place, and I benefit as a white person, even if I arrived in 1965.</p>\n\n<p>No matter one's own personal views, you can't escape the larger system in which you're operating. Even if I'm not personally racist or if I can say, Oh, I've got plenty of black friends, I've got plenty of Latino friends. It doesn't matter in the end, unless the overall system has changed, because the question is, How did I get my job? I got my job most likely through social connections, through somebody I know who told me about it and put in a good word for me. And most likely that's somebody white, because whites own more companies and control more jobs.</p>\n\n<p>How did I get to live where I live? I have more freedom because I'm white. I can choose to live in a predominantly white neighborhood, and I can actually choose to live in a predominantly minority neighborhood, without facing the same kind of resistance had the situation been reversed.</p>\n\n<p>So, no matter what your personal views about race are and who your friends are, whites are still advantaged, in an institutional and social way, that often they don't even recognize.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about affirmative action?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People who criticize affirmative action as antithetical to a colorblind society aren't recognizing that we're not in a colorblind society. Already color matters, and affirmative action is just a way to counteract some of those overall trends. First of all, whites and blacks are coming from very different economic circumstances, due to a long history of economic and political exclusion from blacks. Also, there's the cultural and psychological legacy of generations of racial oppression.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people say that affirmative action is problematic because it's giving preference to a single group, but we're doing that already all the time in our \"colorblind\" society. Take the example of college admissions. Sure, there are racial preferences, but those are only meant to countervail some of the more subtle preferences that tend to benefit whites. For example, look at legacies. Kids who have a parent who went to that college have an increased chance of getting into the college. It's an explicit policy among admissions officers. Since whites, in the past, were more likely to have gone to college, especially elite colleges, that's conferring racial advantage, without ever being an explicit racial policy. Affirmative action is one way to counteract that.</p>\n\n<p>Another criticism of affirmative action is that it stigmatizes the group that's receiving the aid. So if a white sees a minority kid in the hallways of Yale or Harvard, they always think, well, did he get in because of affirmative action or does he really \"deserve\" to be here? No one says the same thing about legacies, who get in at a much higher rate. Now, that's because race is something that we can clearly mark or identify, in a way that you can't see whether someone's parent went to Yale or Harvard on their lapel when they're walking down the hallway, as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, it is true that affirmative action as it's currently designed has some stigmatizing aspects, but it can be mended. I think it shouldn't be eliminated, because the absence of it would mean that we're doing nothing at all to level the playing field, when we recognize there's enormous disparities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any personal experiences you draw upon in your work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So much of the discourse about race today is about how race disadvantages minorities. People hardly ever talk about the other half of the coin, which is, How does race benefit whites? And I think it benefits whites in many ways, and some are very evident from my own personal experience.</p>\n\n<p>Having grown up as a white minority in a community of color and in a community of housing projects at that, I'm able to see, in a way that many whites take for granted, the advantages that distinguish me from my neighbors. For example, when my local school deteriorated so badly that my parents had to get me out of there and had no money to move or to send me to private school, they had a friend, a social connection on the other side of town, on the rich side of town, that let us lie to the school board and use his address to say that we were in that school district, and go to a well-funded, well-run school.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's an example of my white privilege because my parents had both the confidence and the sense of entitlement that the system was theirs for the taking. And, at the same time, they had a connection, a white person on the other side of town who lived in a wealthy neighborhood, who let us use is address. So they had both the cultural resources and the social connection that fostered my mobility to a better school district, over and above money. There's a way that race matters.</p>\n\n<p>When I was an adolescent I made a big mistake with a friend of mine after school where I set his apartment on fire. After the fire was put out and the fire marshals and the police came and did their investigation, they decided to let us go. They said, \"You seem like good kids who did a really stupid thing. We'll leave it up to your families to discipline you.\" So this didn't go on my record.

And when you look at assets you don't get this notion of a meritocracy. People are still quite unequal, even when they have similar achievements in life.</p>"},"field_full_length_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>What inspired your studies of race and wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I went to UCLA it was the common experience of many African American faculty that they could not secure housing close to the campus. Many of the faculty went into African American neighborhoods that required a commute to the university. Others used the strategy that I ended up using, which was to use a white colleague to go with me when I made the application, and to vouch for me. And so I experienced firsthand how difficult it was - even in the post-Civil Rights era of the late 1970s - for an African American to secure housing.</p>\n\n<p>As time went by, I noticed that many of my colleagues were doing quite well - living in nice neighborhoods with good schools for their kids - conditions that I consider to be the social capital that makes life easier for the next generation. And I was looking at myself and I realized that I didn't have these things. Now what's wrong here? We make the same salary. We are all doing well professionally. And what I discovered was it all came down to the difference between income and assets. I had income but I didn't have the assets, what I call the third pillar of economic security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the difference between income and assets?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We all want the things that can provide us with better life chances. We want to have an opportunity for education. We want to have good housing. We want to have good medical care. We want to make sure that the next generation is going to be better off than the previous generation.</p>\n\n<p>Those kinds of life chances depend on a certain combination of income and wealth. Many people think of income as being the basic thing for all of those life chances. But in reality, income usually goes into your pocket and out of your pocket. It provides for your basic standard of living.</p>\n\n<p>But wealth - your savings, investments or inheritances from the previous generation - those are the resources that you use to really establish your opportunities in life. Getting an education for your kids, purchasing a home, handling catastrophic illness, leaving a legacy for future generations. Wealth is really what provides for the life chances that you want your children to have. Income alone doesn't do it.</p>\n\n<p>Look at the example of purchasing a home. The average home in America costs about $150,000. Twenty percent down payment is $30,000. You don't get that $30,000 from income. You usually get it from wealth - your savings, your investment. And a lot of the research we've done points out that many first-time home buyers get that down payments from their parents. Parents typically use their wealth to help their children generate wealth in their lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>One of the theories about assets says, income feeds your stomachs, but assets changes your head. That is, you really do act differently when you have a cushion of assets so that you can strategize around important opportunities in life. When you are living from paycheck to paycheck you just think about how you're making the next day or the next week or the next month happen. But when you have a set of resources that allow you to think about your future in a positive way, you can strategize about the future, create and take advantage of opportunity. Otherwise you stay in the present. And I think the key to a fast-paced economy is taking advantage of new opportunities as they come along. And that doesn't happen when you just depend on income. You have to have a wealth or an asset base that allows you to take advantage of that future.</p>\n\n<p>The average American has most of their wealth in the equity in their home. That's why I think homeownership is so important in this society. I think of homeownership as the first step to wealth accumulation, because with homeownership and equity you have so many options afterwards. Leaving your home to your next generation is a huge legacy you can leave. Using the equity in your home to help your children achieve an education is a big advantage. You can use it to take advantage of important opportunities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are race and wealth related?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The difference between wealth and income is really highlighted when you look at differences among blacks and whites. While blacks make sixty-two cents of every dollar of income that whites make, they only have ten cents for every dollar of wealth that whites have. The gap for wealth is much greater than the gap for income. So if wealth is important for securing life chances, then blacks have a very difficult time doing that compared to whites.</p>\n\n<p>Why is there this large difference in the wealth resources between blacks and whites? Well, I think there are a couple of very important reasons. One, there's a historical legacy. Income is based on what you can sell your labor market skills in the labor market for. So if you have a college education, you go out and try to sell those resources and you get a certain amount of income. But wealth is not just about contemporary issues. It's also about the legacy of the past. If three generations ago your family had wealth, that wealth has passed to the next generation. And it's a strong likelihood that it's passed further on to the next generation. But African Americans have a history where there has been little wealth in the past, therefore making it more likely that there's little wealth in the future. And when you look at that history, you see a history of oppression, a history of slavery, a history of de facto discrimination, and a history where it's been difficult for blacks to take the little income they've had to create wealth.</p>\n\n<p>I think a prime example has been what happened when blacks were freed from slavery, the period in which there was great hope. One of the things that many of us hear about is the broken promise of forty acres and a mule. And that was an important promise, because those forty acres, that was wealth. That was what could have secured a foundation for a generation of people that had had little wealth. But as we know, those forty acres promised at the end of the Civil War did not materialize.</p>\n\n<p>However, during the same period, a large land reform did occur in America, and that was homesteading. A whole generation of Americans moved from east to west and secured land as far away as California that served as a basis for wealth that has been passed down from generation to generation. For a large part of that time, African Americans were excluded from that benefit.</p>\n\n<p>So you see two very important things that occurred. And these were public policy decisions in which, on one hand, people were given access to property, given title and subsequently wealth. And on the other hand, people were not given access to property, did not generate wealth, and did not generate opportunity for the next generation. If you add that up over time, what you get is a situation in which public policy provides opportunities for some and opportunities for another. This is how America became racialized - it is the meaning of race in America.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth gap between blacks and whites is a crucial factor in the relative health and stability of the communities they live in. Obviously wealth has a lot to do with where people are going to live. Where people live has a lot to do with the kind of schooling their children will have. And the kind of schooling available has a lot to do with the opportunities their children will have. Wealth creates the opportunities that set the next generation's life chances.</p>\n\n<p>One of the difficulties that African American families have is the constant stress that comes from barely being able to make it from paycheck to paycheck. People who have wealth can rely on it during difficult times. When there's a crisis that requires unforeseen health care expenditures, when there's an investment that has to be made in a child's schooling, when there's an opportunity to provide for a son or daughter so that they can purchase a home - all of these things are dependent not on having sufficient income but having the kind of assets or wealth that you can draw upon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has public policy defined race in America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race in itself means nothing - the markers of race, skin color, hair texture, the things that we identify as racial markers - mean nothing unless they are given social meaning and unless there's public policy and private actions that act upon those kinds of characteristics. When you look at racial differences and racial inequality through the lens of wealth, it pushes us to look at the whole history of America from slavery through today and examine the public policies and private actions that generated these differences. And when you see slavery that was based on the color of skin, when you see public policies like the differences in the homestead and land reform, based mainly on the color of the skin, that creates race. That creates the social manifestations of what we consider to be the social construction of race in America.</p>\n\n<p>And it's interesting that a lot of these racialized outcomes came out of the most progressive legislation in American history - the whole set of legislation during the New Deal which created Social Security, created Aid to Families with Dependent Children, created the mortgage markets that make it possible for buying homes. For example, Social Security was originally set up to exclude all agricultural workers. Well, at the time most African Americans were still working in agricultural sectors. So up until the change in Social Security, most African Americans were not covered.</p>\n\n<p>If there's one thing I want people to understand about the wealth gap in America, it is that this was a gap created by public institutions that gave different opportunities for different people to create, nurture and gain assets. And as such, I think it's also one of the areas that public decisions can make a difference in creating some equity - public decisions that can encourage more investment and savings for African Americans and poor people. I think we have, at our disposal, a set of policies that can help preserve and nurture the assets that people of color have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why can't people rise above this wealth gap? If you work hard and take care of your finances, shouldn't an individual be able to surpass this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What's really disturbing about the wealth gap is that even when you control for differences between people, the discrepancy is still quite large. In other words, if you just compare people with similar backgrounds - college graduates, stable families with both parents working, etc. - they are still divided sharply when it comes to wealth. It really makes you question the notion that if you work hard, you do all the things right, that you will gain equivalency, especially racially, with your white counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>I think this notion that there's a meritocracy - that all you have to do is hit the right chord, then the music will play sweet - is not a reality for African Americans. Assets really divide America more than income. And when you look at assets you don't get this notion of a meritocracy. People are still quite unequal, even when they have similar achievements in life.</p>\n\n<p>Even when you compare the black poor and the white poor, there are significant differences. The black poor tend to have longer periods of poverty - poverty spells - than the white poor. The white poor tends to be episodically poor. That is, they go through spells, a half a year or so where they might be in poverty. They're out of work. They've used up all their resources. That kind of poverty. The black poor tend to have longer poverty spells, and sometimes, as we've seen, intergenerational poverty. Poverty that goes from one household to another household, from a single-parent household headed by a woman with children to another single-parent household headed by a woman with children. These are big differences.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons for these differences is that the white poor tend to live in communities that do not have concentrated poverty. White people tend to live with a range of economic classes. The black poor tend to live in concentrated poverty communities - communities in which 30-40% or more of the people are also poor. So the resources and opportunities they have around them tend to be much different than the resources that the white poor has. The white poor often times can take advantage of opportunities. They're in relatively resource-rich communities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does housing history and homeownership contribute to racialized discrepancies in wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think one of the most interesting sets of decisions has to do with the realm of housing. In order to purchase a house in America prior to the 1930s, you had to pay up to 50% of the sales price up front. The rest was subject to interest, and at the end of five years you had to pay the remaining balance as a lump sum. Obviously, with that type of arrangement, there were very few middle class people who could buy a home in America. Mainly buying homes was an upper middle class and upper class phenomenon. But the 1930s created a whole new set of opportunities for Americans to purchase homes. The federal government came in to create and sustain the construction industry. And to do that, they created the Federal Housing Administration, whose job it was to provide loans, or the backing for loans, to average Americans so they could purchase a home.</p>\n\n<p>The tables were turned completely around. The new terms of purchasing a home was that you put 10% or 20% down, and the bank financed 80% of it - not over five years, but over thirty years - at relatively low rates. This opened up the opportunities for Americans to own homes like never before. The average person could own a home. Furthermore, the FHA allowed no or low down payments for certain kinds of homes. So as a consequence the housing industry boomed in the midst of the Depression, because the federal government was trying to create jobs for people, boost the housing industry.</p>\n\n<p>So you had this great opportunity. But it was a color-coded opportunity. How? In order for homes to receive financing, they would have to be certified by home appraisers. The appraisers were given written criteria that assigned colors to different types of homes. Green was the highest value - green homes were homes that were in all-white neighborhoods, usually suburban, and far away from communities that were either integrated or all black. Red was the lowest value - red neighborhoods were in all-minority or mixed communities and were usually in inner cities. These homes rarely got mortgages. The vast majority of mortgages were reserved for homes in all-white suburban areas. This appraisal method came to be known as redlining. This color-coded criteria was central in determining who got loans and who didn't. They didn't say blacks couldn't get loans. But they did say communities in which there were few blacks could get loans. As a consequence, most of the mortgages went to suburbanizing America, and it suburbanized it racially. Today metropolitan America is made up of white suburbs and African American inner cities.</p>\n\n<p>This appraisal system has greatly influenced the net worth or wealth of the average American today. Today, the value of the suburban house that was purchased in 1940 has gone up tremendously. So much so that the discrepancy between the net worth of these homeowners and the net worth of the inner-city residents and minorities that were excluded from these programs is astounding. A perfect example is the communities on the East Coast that are called Levittowns. These were mass-market suburban housing tracts that were built at very, very reasonable cost. As a matter of fact, in the suburbs of New York or Philadelphia you could get a two-bedroom Levittown home for $5,000 to $7,000. Most of those communities did not require a down payment. Many people stood in line for days waiting to sign up - the first one in line got the home.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially this resulted in the social construction of racialized space - a space in which whites lived in the suburbs, blacks lived in the inner city. Furthermore they created these differences, these vast differences in wealth. If you look at the 1994 survey of income and program participation, you can see that a homeowner that purchased a Levittown type home in 1950 for about $5,000 now has about $300,000 in home equity. That's an investment that has grown tremendously over time. According to the same survey, an African American family that did not have an opportunity to buy that home, or who had to purchase a home in the inner city, has substantially less wealth. So that's how you start to see how this huge gap between white and black wealth was created.</p>\n\n<p>These were FHA-financed homes. The homes in Levittowns all had what we call restrictive covenants. These were legal, binding agreements that said no one who was Black, Latino, Chinese, and in some cases Jewish, could purchase those homes. Not only would the FHA support these covenants, but they would provide an example of a legally-enforceable, racially restrictive covenant in their pamphlets to home buyers.</p>\n\n<p>In 1949, the Supreme Court ruling in Shelley vs. Kraemer deemed restrictive covenants unenforceable and racially discriminatory. In 1950, FHA said they would no longer enforce them and stopped including them in their guidelines. Nonetheless, people continued use racially restrictive covenants throughout the 1960s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has this affected today's housing market?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the drivers of continuing differences between African Americans and whites in terms of wealth has been the fact that white homes in white neighborhoods tend to increase in value over time, much more so than black homes in mixed or black communities. To understand why, we have to understand how institutional decisions are the real drivers behind this.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there are black middle-class communities like Prince George's County where people have four or five-bedroom homes on large lots of land - classically suburban, beautiful places in reasonable commuting distance of Washington, D.C. These homes should have a very, very high value. But what those African American middle class families have found is that as the community has become more black, the housing market has become softer. That is, the prices have declined or stayed the same.</p>\n\n<p>Yet white communities and homes that are similar to and in some cases less prestigious than those in Prince George's County have continued to rise. What happens here is that as African Americans move in, whites deem those communities to be less desirable, and white flight occurs. As whites leave, other whites do not think of those communities as places to go. Consequently, the market must be sustained by black homebuyers. But if you consider that African Americans are 20% of the buyer's market, it means that 80% of the people are not looking in those places for homes and therefore the prices of those homes decline or stay stable.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, banks contribute to this by continually making loans in regions that are on the rise - i.e., white communities - and make it difficult to get loans in black communities. Federal Reserve studies have shown that equally creditworthy black and white families have very different mortgage decision outcomes. That is, blacks are 20% more likely to be declined loans than whites. Banks are making decisions not so much on the creditworthiness of their applicants, but on their perceptions of black homebuyers and the values of homes in black communities. Therefore we still have a very stratified and racially conscious banking system that perpetuates this cycle of white flight and decreasing property values.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the bottom line in the home finance market is that there is a black tax. That is, black communities are on average undervalued compared to equivalent white communities. On the other side, minorities trying to enter the market often face predatory lenders who essentially overvalue the community so as to strip the community of its resources. These institutions make huge profits by targeting minority communities and providing loans at exorbitant interest rates with very difficult conditions. So we have two different forces working - the mainstream financial community undervaluing these communities and the predatory lending community overvaluing them and reaping the resources. So it's a very interesting development that's going on, this dual system of undervaluing on the one hand, overvaluing on the other, and in both cases to the detriment of minority and poor communities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I'm a white person and I'm actually being advantaged under this present system, why should I be concerned about the wealth gap among races?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question. I think throughout American history we've had what George Lipsitz calls a \"possessive investment in being white.\" In other words, there is a whole set of privileges that are bestowed upon white people. The opportunity to homestead, the opportunity to take advantage of the FHA's programs, better opportunities for schooling, better opportunities for securing loans. These are all privileges. But they also create inequity in a society.</p>\n\n<p>And a society that has those kinds of inequities will consistently have a number of fallouts. Periodic bursts in violence stemming from issues of race and class have occurred throughout American history, from early times, the 1960s, and continuing in the 1990s with riots in Los Angeles and most recently, Cincinnati.</p>\n\n<p>But you also have a fallout in terms of cost to the general public. Social costs such as more prisons, increased expenditures on an educational system that doesn't work, increased expenditures on illnesses that are preventable. These are all significant costs felt throughout the population. Costs that create antagonism from both sides. Whites, for having to pay it; African Americans and people of color for having to feel like they are causing additional expenses to society as opposed to simply getting equal access to resources. I think that there's also a psychological burden on people who see the inequality and know that they are a part of that system. So there are a number of reasons why I think white Americans should think of these things as important and relevant to them. When half the population is not reaching their human potential, or we do not use their human potential, then we have something to worry about as a society.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e1364a55-f51c-423a-8ca8-aa358bfcf496","name":"Structured Advantage: Legislation and Government Policy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"66d1f34e-1b54-4f88-a147-9a0e19aeac3a","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Housing and Ownership","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}},{"id":"b6696374-c1d9-45c7-b69a-41da2314f0a9","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Intergenerational Wealth and Poverty","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Wealth Gap","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"The Hidden Cost of Being African American","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Whites are wealthier than African Americans, and whites' wealth advantage is much bigger than their advantages in either income or education.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Michael Hout"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/0a1fc3d4330a47ec850c96f3157f65c1-fb6f0139a08046e54ad296e9c98f2815.png"}}}},{"title":"Segregated Housing and the Racial Wealth Gap","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/d6496c4a4fa69484ccfc4c847216fa83-e219e7eeef7ed6a01062b712d491d368.png"}}}},{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Are reparations for slavery appropriate?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>It would probably be useful to list some of the complications or arguments against reparations, simply because people may not be aware of what issues are involved.

First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time. And without at least some crude approximation of that, it's extremely hard to make all of these assumptions about what group outperforms another group. It's also not true to fact. Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races. So, to try to make any judgments about one group versus another is extremely difficult when variation is the rule of the game. Abilities change through time.

You wouldn't find any political support for it, but essentially that's the mechanism that created the middle class and also created racial inequity through homeownership and real estate. The different mechanisms people are talking about are basically ways of changing how people actually decide the value of their homes. In other words, introducing some sort of financial incentive for people not to make certain choices. This is a great example of how people's individual choices perpetuate racism in a way that they don't obviously think about. So it's a great way to illustrate how our choices actually can change these systems.
