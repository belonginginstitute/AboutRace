The idea of a permanent affirmative action policy is used to scare people who might otherwise support affirmative action. Affirmative action opponents play upon fears that proactive measures will become a politically inscribed remedy that society will never be rid of once they are put into place. Past practice has proven that that's just not the case. At the outset of affirmative action programs, women were incredibly underrepresented in fields such as law and medicine and that gap was quickly eliminated within just a couple of years. Since then, in most programs, women (as an aggregate category) no longer benefit from affirmative action. The same thing happened with various subcategories of Asians at schools in the 1970s. For example, Japanese Americans were removed from affirmative action consideration at the UC Berkeley law school. Historically, admissions committees have used representational numbers as a guideline for which groups continue to need affirmative action and which ones do not.</p>\n\n<p>But note that legislation such as the new Ward Connerly initiative (the racial privacy initiative that's actually being renamed the \"Information Ban Initiative\") seeks to ban the collection of race-based data as an outdated invasion of privacy. Should such an ill-advised measure succeed, it would be impossible to measure progress (or setbacks). If we are supposed to be an egalitarian society, don't we want to know where the racial disparities are? Don't we care that Dorothy Roberts, in her recent book Shattered Bonds, discovered that 95% of all the children in the foster care system in Chicago are black? Or that 42% of the children in the foster care system nationwide are black even though they constitute only 17% of the nation's children? If we do care, then we need to keep records as a measure for devising social policies to address these troubling disparities.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"01fd3b5a-d403-49b5-90a6-ae46e91454fc"}}
