Recognizing important distinctions among the categories \"natural,\" \"biological\" and \"genetic\" is a key to making sense of this controversy.</p>\n\n<p>Human races are not genetically definable categories. There are no subdivisions found \"in nature\" that separate one race or group of humans from another. Race might be better defined as a social hierarchy - a set of social relationships through which some groups of people are subordinated while others are elevated in power and status.</p>\n\n<p>Although races are created socially they are, nonetheless, real, in the same sense that marriage or the school year are real. Furthermore, as we relate to each other in terms of race, we create material conditions in the world. Race is a powerful predictor of where a person lives, where and to what degree she is educated, how much money she makes, whether she has health insurance, how she is treated by physicians, and the degree to which she is exposed to toxic substances in her work or home environment. These material manifestations of race can have direct and indirect health consequences, thereby establishing a relationship between the social realities of race and our human biology.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, human organisms respond biologically to social experience. We do find racial disparities in rates of diabetes or responses to medications, and these are important to study. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is that when we observe racial differences in health status we should not infer that these are caused by genetic differences between/among races. Our current knowledge suggests that genetics is the least likely cause of most racial disparities in health.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks    "},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null,"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"be792eba-e162-4441-abb6-f7c943962a6d","name":"Science: Pseudoscience","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"Health","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Is it true that people metabolize drugs at different rates and that this correlates with \"racial\" groupings?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>People do metabolize drugs at different rates, and this is due to many factors, only some of which are genetic.

Furthermore, studies have shown that Japanese people (a nationality of Asian people) in Japan require a lower dose of warfarin than Japanese people in the US to achieve a therapeutic dose. (Id. p.818)</p>\n\n<p>This example highlights the important point that when we see racial differences in some medical outcome, we should not assume that the differences are genetic. This example also reminds us how difficult it is to make categorical claims about drug metabolism and people of any particular race and ethnicity. In any given study, the answers you get may depend on which white people or which Asian people or which black people you are studying. Are these new immigrants or people who are deeply acculturated to mainstream U.S. lifestyles? Are these white people in the United States or in France, or Chinese people in China or the United States? The answer may also depend on whether you are studying people who are a majority or a minority. And whether you are studying people who are wealthy or poor. All of these features can make a difference in medical outcome, including drug metabolism. The problem is that these environmental features often co-vary with race, making it difficult to determine the exact explanation for observed differences between racial groups.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I think that scientists have a responsibility not to over interpret statistically unreliable data, which is what has happened a lot recently - claims are made on the basis of data that are not statistically significant, and claims are made on the basis of one experiment. This is irresponsible because such data might be misleading and one experiment generally cannot sort out all possible causal explanations. It's dangerous to assume that if you see a difference it's due to genetics. When you don't know the explanation, you have to be very careful about making essentialist claims - that what was true for this study will always be true - that Japanese people, for example, will always need less warfarin than white people. It may not always be true.<br />\n </p>"},"changed":1531506382},{"title":"What role should race play in health research and medicine?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>When it comes to thinking about race and its relationship to medicine and biology, everyone seems to be confused and uneasy.

I hope we wouldn't assume today that basic differences in infant mortality between whites and blacks are due to some sort of inherent differences between those two groups that I've just defined by color. Instead, we should look at, what are the social, economic, and political processes that might explain why, at this point and time in the United States, we see such glaring differences in infant mortality between blacks and whites.</p>"},"changed":1531505190},{"title":"What role should race play in health research and medicine?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>When it comes to thinking about race and its relationship to medicine and biology, everyone seems to be confused and uneasy.
