Why doesn't it make sense to group humans the same way?</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>Subspecies are animal groups that are related, can interbreed, and yet have characteristics that make them distinct from one another. Two basic ingredients are critical to the development of separate subspecies: isolation and time. Unlike most animals, humans are a relatively young species and we are extremely mobile, so we simply haven't evolved into different subspecies.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest hominids evolved from apes about 5 million years ago, but modern humans (Homo sapien sapiens) didn't emerge until 150,000-200,000 years ago in eastern Africa, where we spent most of our evolution together as a species. Our species first left Africa only about 50,000-100,000 years ago and quickly spread across the entire world. All of us descended from these recent African ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>Many other animal species have been around much longer or they have shorter lifespans, so they've had many more opportunities to accumulate genetic variants. Penguins, for example, have twice as much genetic diversity as humans. Fruit flies have 10 times as much. Even our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been around at least several million years. There's more genetic diversity within a group of chimps on a single hillside in Gomba than in the entire human species.</p>\n\n<p>Domesticated animals such as dogs also have a lot of genetic diversity, but this is mostly due to selective breeding under controlled conditions. Humans, on the other hand, have always mixed freely and widely. As a result, we're all mongrels: Eighty-five percent of all human variation can be found in any local population, whether they be Kurds, Icelanders, Papua New Guineans, or Mongolians. Ninety-four percent can be found on any continent.</p>\n\n<p>Animals are also limited by habitat and geographical features such as rivers and canyons, so it is easy for groups to become isolated and genetically distinct from one another. Humans, on the other hand, are much more adaptable and have not been limited by geography in the same way. Early on, we could ford rivers, cross canyons, move great distances over a relatively short time, and modify our environment to fit our needs. We are also extremely mobile as a species. Even the remotest island tribe in the Pacific originally came from elsewhere and maintained some contact with neighboring groups.</p>\n\n<p>We may think global migration is a recent phenomenon, but it has characterized most of human history. Whether we're moving halfway around the world or from one village to another, the passage of genes takes place under many circumstances, large-scale and small: migration, wars, trade, slave-taking, rape, and exogamous marriage (marriage with \"outsiders\").</p>\n\n<p>It takes a long time to accumulate a lot of genetic variation because new variants arise only through mutation - copying errors from one generation to the next. On the other hand, it takes just a very small amount of migration - one individual in each generation moving from one village to another and reproducing - to prevent groups from becoming genetically distinct or isolated. Humans just haven't evolved into distinct subgroups.</p>\n\n<p>But we can see obvious differences between people - don't those translate into deeper differences, like propensity for certain diseases?</p>\n\n<p>The visual differences we are attuned to don't tell us anything about what's beneath the skin. This is because human variation is highly non-concordant. Most traits are influenced by different genes, so they're inherited independently, not grouped into the few packages we call races. In other words, the presence of one trait doesn't guarantee the presence of another. Can you tell a person's eye color from their height? What about their blood type from the size of their head? What about subtler things like a person's ability to play sports or their mathematical skills? It doesn't make sense to talk about group racial characteristics, whether external or internal.</p>\n\n<p>Genetic differences do exist between people, but it is more accurate to speak of ancestry, rather than race, as the root of inherited diseases or conditions. Not everyone who looks alike or lives in the same region shares a common ancestry, so using \"race\" as a shorthand for ancestry can be misleading. Sickle cell, for example, often thought of as a \"racial\" disease afflicting Africans, is actually a gene that confers resistance to malaria, so it occurs in areas such as central and western Africa, the Mediterranean, and Arabia, but not in southern Africa. In medicine, a simplistic view can lead to misdiagnoses, with fatal consequences. Racial \"profiling\" isn't appropriate on the New Jersey Turnpike or in the doctor's office. As evolutionary biologist Joseph Graves reminds us, medicine should treat individuals, not groups.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the social reality of race can have biological effects. Native Americans have the highest rates of diabetes and African American men die of heart disease five times more often than white men. But is this a product of biology or social conditions? How do you measure this relationship or even determine who is Native American or African American on a genetic level? Access to medical care, health insurance, and safe living conditions can certainly affect medical outcomes. So can the stress of racism. But the reasons aren't innate or genetic.</p>\n\n<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality. Understanding that race is socially constructed is the first step in addressing those factors and giving everyone a fair chance in life.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"5c399d5d-6d46-449d-aab1-dcb77fdf1835","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Race does matter.

You're trying, most often, to find a person, so you're looking for unique markers, not ones that are generalizable to a group. Secondly, it kind of is a game in which you have to make, first, the assumption that there is such a thing as race. And then if you do put individuals into four or five essential types, the more data you look at - just by matter of pure statistics - the higher your probabilities are going to be of sorting into those groups. But just because you do it doesn't mean that those groups that you set up in the first place have any sort of biological validity to them.</p>\r\n","format":"basic_html","processed":"<p>Like some of the other questions, especially the one on bone marrow, we have to look at the assumption that is embedded in the question, which is the idea that forensic investigators actually are good at telling an individual's race from their bones or from a fragment of their DNA. I can very clearly say that this assumption is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, there were a number of forensic studies in which they tried to separate individuals into different so-called races depending on what they were looking at in the bones - size and shapes of skulls mostly. And they thought they had it. But when any of these studies has been replicated, looking at individuals from a different area or a different time, the results, sadly, are little better than random assignment.</p>\n\n<p>I think the reason why this is true is very interesting. It really smacks at how fluid social definitions of race are and even how fluid, sometimes, biologies are. Biology can change, or at least phenotypes can change, from generation to generation. So if you did an initial study on say, bones of so-called blacks and whites in Cleveland, and then do a study of so-called blacks, whites, and Native Americans in Arizona, you actually find that the blacks in Arizona look different from the blacks in Cleveland. And the whites, in fact, look so different that one could even assign them into a different \"race.\" In the same way, maybe, we could say Japanese immigrants look different once they come to the United States versus when they were in Japan.</p>\n\n<p>The DNA question is a little bit different. I think the answer to that one is that we're not identifying race, we are identifying individuals. Individual DNA is what's unique. Let's face it, it's not important to find a race, it's important to find an individual. That question also very much applies to medicine.

They tended to run away from slave plantations. He attributed this odd behavior to a disease peculiar to Negroes. He even gave the affliction a name, \"drapetomania.\" </p>\n\n<p>Cartwright's \"run-away\" disease elicits derisive laughter today. So too do all the other 19th and early 20th century exertions to distinguish races by facial angle, skull size, cranial index, length of shin bone and blood type. Our growing knowledge of the genome and human evolutionary history help us understand why all such efforts to locate the source of innate racial difference were doomed: it doesn't exist. Most geneticists and anthropologists who study human variation agree that humans just don't come bundled into three or four separate groups according to skin color and other physical traits. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, \"discoveries\" of racial difference resurface in the press with predictable regularity. Often they spotlight differential rates of diseases, or responses to a drug. Sometimes they zero in on a genetics study.</p>\n\n<p>That was the case recently with a report published in Science magazine (Dec. 20, 2002). Noah Rosenberg, Marcus Feldman and others analyzed the variation in 377 different DNA sequences from 1056 individuals from around the world. They found that 95% of the DNA variation they studied is due to differences between individuals within any continent. But they also found they could use the remaining 5% of the variation as genetic \"footprints\" indicating the continent from which an individual's recent ancestors came. </p>\n\n<p>Some were quick to interpret these results as evidence that old-fashioned notions of the \"races of man\" have been correct all along. But does it? What do these studies actually tell us? And why should our interpretations matter?</p>\n\n<p>Reports about such studies commonly fall prey to three confusions: they conflate DNA markers of ancestry with markers of race. They mistake the fact that some gene variants are more common in some populations than others as signs of racial \"difference\" between those populations. And they assume that disparities in group outcomes can be attributed to inborn, or genetic, differences between races. </p>\n\n<p>The idea of biological race assumes traits come packaged together, even color-coded for our convenience, as anthropologist Jonathan Marks jokes. In otherwords, if biological race were real, we'd find that skin color or other \"racial\" markers would correlate with a suite of other genetic traits. Knowing an individual's \"race\" should enable us to predict his or her other genes and traits.</p>\n\n<p>But the DNA sequences studied by Rosenberg and his colleagues are not genes. Known by geneticists as \"microsatellite short tandem repeats\" (and more colloquially as \"junk DNA\"), they do not code for proteins, but just sit there taking up space in our DNA. Mutations in DNA sequences that don't code for anything are not affected by natural and sexual selection. They are neither selected for nor against but are simply passed down, generation to generation. Comparing these accumulated mutation patterns can provide clues to ancient population movements. But they have no effect on physical traits such as skin color or hair form or blood type.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the study accomplished the same thing our eyes do everyday. You can look at someone and stand a pretty good chance of identifying the continent where that person's recent ancestors lived, especially if you're gazing at someone whose family has resided in the same place for several generations - as did all the subjects of the study. </p>\n\n<p>But what's that got to do with \"race\"? We all have ancestors from elsewhere - and if we go back far enough, about 70,000 or so years ago, all our ancestors can be traced back to Africa. But if our idea of race assumes that different groups each share among themselves a different suite of inborn traits, then we have to ask, \"What difference makes a difference?\" Certainly not micro-satellite short tandem repeats.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there's no question that some gene forms show up more often in some populations than others: alleles that code for blue eyes, or the A, B, O blood groups, and of course, those alleles that influence skin color. (We all have the same 30,000 or so genes. But some genes come in different forms, or varieties, called alleles.) But just because some members of a population might carry a specific gene form, doesn't mean all members do. Only a small percentage of Ashkenazi Jews carry the Tay-Sachs allele. When a couple I know were screened upon their pregnancy, the non-Jewish partner was found to be the Tay-Sachs carrier, not the Jewish one.</p>\n\n<p>That's because most human variation falls within, not between populations. About 85% of all genetic variation can, on average, be found within any local population, be they Swedes, Kikuyu, or Hmong. About 94% can be found within any continental population, consistent with what the Rosenberg Science study found. In fact, there are no characteristics, no traits, not even one gene that turns up in all members of one so-called race yet is absent from others. </p>\n\n<p>Take sickle cell. Doctors were long taught that sickle cell anemia was a genetic disease of Negroes, a marker of their race. Yet sickle cell is found among peoples from central and western Africa, but not southern Africa. It is also carried by Turks, Yemenis, Indians, Greeks, and Sicilians. That's because sickle cell arose several thousand years ago as a mutation in one of the genes that codes for hemoglobin. The mutation soon spread to successive populations along the trade routes where malaria was common. It turns out that inheriting one sickle cell allele confers resistance to malaria and thus provides a selective advantage in malarial regions (inheriting sickle cell alleles from both parents causes sickle-cell disease). In other words, sickle cell, like tandem repeats in the Science study, is a marker not of skin color or race but ancestry, or more precisely, having ancestors from where malaria was common. </p>\n\n<p>Like sickle cell, most traits are influenced by separate genes and inherited independently one from another. They are said to be \"non-concordant.\" Someone with brown hair might carry A, B or O blood. Sub-Saharan Africans tend to have dark skin. But so too do Dravidians from India, Aborigines from Australia, and Melanesians from the South Pacific. Large numbers of West Africans are lactose intolerant as are Japanese, but East Africans aren't. German and Papua New Guinean populations have almost exactly the same frequencies of A, B and O blood. At one point on the genome an individual might share a gene form common in Africa, at another site East Asia, and still another, Europe. Jared Diamond and others have pointed out that for each trait we can classify people into \"races\" by that trait, each giving us different and overlapping races depending on the trait selected.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Rosenberg team found they could cluster the individuals in their sample into several different statistically significant groups, only one of which corresponded to five continents. They also found that no matter which clustering scheme they used, individuals could be placed in more than one group. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for all this within-group variation is because unlike most other species, modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, are young, only about 150,000 years or so old, and we've always moved. As humans migrated around the globe, populations bumped into each other and shared their mates - and genes. Sometimes genes flowed across great distances - through trade, war, slavery, piracy, exile and migration. More often they flowed from village to village to village. Human populations just haven't been isolated from each other long enough to evolve into separate sub-species, or races.</p>\n\n<p>Ancestry is important in genetics and health care. I would like to know if I were descended from a population at risk for sickle cell, or the blood disease porphyria, or Tay Sachs. Oliver Sachs has even written famously of an island of the colorblind. But because of non-concordance, the geographic shape of populations at genetic risk for a specific disease or adverse drug response change amoeba-like depending upon the trait under study. These populations do not map onto what we think of as race. To assume they do is medically troublesome on several accounts. </p>\n\n<p>First, doctors might be tempted to use race as a very unreliable surrogate for an individual's own unique ancestry and patterns of inheritance. And insofar as 94% of all genetic variants can be found within any continent, assigning someone to a \"racial\" continent of origin is too gross a scale to narrow down the range of possibilities very much. (Some variants do correlate on a finer scale with ethnic groups, and on a scale smaller yet with recent family descent.)</p>\n\n<p>But a belief in biological race also obscures the very salient consequences of race as lived experience. Race may be a biological myth, a social construction, but it nonetheless remains very real. It can even have biological effects. African Americans have among the highest rates of hypertension in the world. This was long assumed to be genetic, a \"marker\" of their nature. But then it was found that West Africans have among the world's lowest hypertension rates. A focus on race as innate biology, as genetic difference, would lead health professionals and policy makers to overlook social factors that might contribute to African American hypertension and heart disease, including the added stressor of living in a racist society. </p>\n\n<p>Race is terribly relevant to life outcomes. The likelihood that toxic waste has been dumped in your neighborhood, your ability to get a home loan, the quality of your kid's education, connections to job opportunities, whether or not you're likely to be followed in a department store or pulled over by police, are all influenced by your race. Race does matter. Not race as genetics but race as lived experience, what sociologists call \"social\" race. Social race is an important variable for health researchers and epidemiologists.</p>\n\n<p>The factors that lead to differential outcomes between races live not in any \"racial\" genes but in our social institutions and practices. It's easy to confuse the two. But doing so, like Dr. Cartwright's drapetomania, displaces our attention from those discriminatory practices to the \"nature\" of the victims. Blindness to the continuing impact of racism can be just as harmful as believing that race is biologically real. They both let society off the hook.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"__typename":"node__clip","id":"dda11171-b3eb-44b4-8fa2-06bd24f545b1","field_episode":2,"title":"Trailer: Just because race doesn't exist in biology doesn't mean it isn't very real, helping shape life chances and opportunities.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/18769983","title":""},"field_title_of_clip":{"processed":"Trailer"},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/e9750bd3cb73ae630c404c92bae145b4-a7ee39236cc83ec6c5784896fa56a665.png","childImageSharp":{"id":"1ea7f86f-2447-59d5-9ebf-d80ec57f602b >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1381,"height":860,"src":"/Race2/static/e9750bd3cb73ae630c404c92bae145b4-a7ee39236cc83ec6c5784896fa56a665.png"},"sizes":{"src":"/Race2/static/e9750bd3cb73ae630c404c92bae145b4-a7ee39236cc83ec6c5784896fa56a665-2fd78.png"},"resolutions":{"height":249,"width":400,"src":"/Race2/static/e9750bd3cb73ae630c404c92bae145b4-a7ee39236cc83ec6c5784896fa56a665-37095.png"}}}},"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"605cc37e-9f28-438a-b7e0-c5b7976597a3","name":"Science: Genetics","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Abolition","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Origin of the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/e3f5057598e4282d7625bcd78f0e26ba-46c6517c120b733ef8c2f9a0ce6c4eb3.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":[{"title":"Trailer: Just because race doesn't exist in biology doesn't mean it isn't very real, helping shape life chances and opportunities.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/18769983","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/e9750bd3cb73ae630c404c92bae145b4-a7ee39236cc83ec6c5784896fa56a665.png"}}}}]}},{"name":"\"The race question\"","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":[{"title":"Trailer: Just because race doesn't exist in biology doesn't mean it isn't very real, helping shape life chances and opportunities.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/18769983","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/e9750bd3cb73ae630c404c92bae145b4-a7ee39236cc83ec6c5784896fa56a665.png"}}}}]}}],"field_article_related_content":[{"__typename":"node__faq","title":"Does mitochondrial DNA change over time?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>Mitochondrial DNA is easy to get and easy to study.

And poor people or working people were the losers in the struggle for existence.</p>"},"field_full_length_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>What are the conventional notions of race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The average person on the street thinks that race consists of differences in physical appearance, in particular things like eye color, eye shape, skin tone, hair type, and aspects of body stature. They also think that from looking at a person's physical appearance, in the way we just described, that they can find out or know more subtle thing about them such as their potential intelligence or their likeliness to be aggressive, to commit crime, predisposition towards disease</p>\n\n<p>The conventional biologist has a similar, though much more rigorous definition of what they mean by race. Those biologists view race as a subdivision of the human species, that can be consistently defined either by a set of physical characteristics or differences in gene frequencies between those populations, so that the term race in a biologist's sense usually refers to a subspecies level of division. And subspecies are actually groups on the way to forming new species.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what I've pointed out, and many others have pointed out for years, is that race is simply not a level of biological division that we find in anatomically modern humans. There are no subspecies in the human beings that live today. So when we use the term race in the biological sense, there's no scientific support for such groups existing.</p>\n\n<p>Human populations do differ, but they don't differ in the ways that most people think, and they certainly don't differ in the ways that 19th century race scientists thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much genetic diversity exists in humans?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The measured amount of genetic variation in the human population is extremely small, and that's something that people need to wrap themselves around, that genetically we really aren't very different from each other. Most of that genetic variability can be found within populations. For example, about 93% of all of the genetic variability that exists on this planet occurs within Sub-Saharan Africans. So, if there were a catastrophe which destroyed the rest of the world's population, 93% of the genetic variability in the world would still be present in Sub-Saharan Africans.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why we don't define races in the human species is because the within-group genetic variability is greater than the between-group genetic variability. Now, that's an elementary component of any statistical tests. If the within-group variability is larger than the between-group variability, then we say that the groups are not different. Now, the way we measure genetic variability in humans, we can do it at a number of levels. You can even use physical variability, and we still wouldn't reconstruct racial groups. If we looked at even skin color and ask ourselves, \"Does skin color map consistently to racial groups?\" the answer is no.</p>\n\n<p>If we measure protein polymorphisms - that is different forms of a protein produced by a given genetic locus - then we would find that 85% of the protein genetic variability that exists in all humans exists at the individual level. That means that any two people in the world have an 85% chance of sharing that protein variant in common. And we would also find that from 6 to 8% of the remaining genetic variability would be at the level of populations on the same continent, and only about 4 to 5% would be at the level of variation between different continents.</p>\n\n<p>The take-home message here is that the amount of within-group genetic variability, within any group that you'd like to choose, such as African Americans, Hispanics, or Euro-Americans, is much greater than the between-group variation - that is, the variation between African Americans and Hispanics or African-Americans and Euro-Americans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can one define any criteria for racial classification?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think about the characteristics used to define our racial categories. If we were to choose another genetic characteristic, we would redefine all of the people currently living in North America into new racial groups. If we chose, for example, blood type, people could be grouped into O blood type races, B blood type races, and A blood type races. If we chose the ability to taste certain chemicals, we would come up with new races. If we chose whether we have whorls or loops in our fingerprints, we would come up with new races. If we chose lactose intolerance we would choose and redefine new races.</p>\n\n<p>And so the ones that were used to socially define American races were done because of our social and political history, and are genetically arbitrary. If we were to do it on different genetic traits, we would come up with new racial groups.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any correlation between race, genetics and disease?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the most pernicious examples of how the race paradigm has misdirected biological research is in the example of medical research, in which physicians are still convinced that there are such things as the black race, the white race, and the Asian race, and that these groups necessarily have differences in genes that predispose them to disease.</p>\n\n<p>Now the reason that this is believed is because when we look at the records of various diseases in America, there are large differences in the percentage of mortality from disease in the socially constructed racial groups. For example, if you look at the 24 categories that the US Bureau of the Census records data for mortality figures, African Americans lead in 22 of the 24 categories. The only categories that African Americans do not lead in is in accidental death and suicide. So for all of the biological causes, African Americans have between 1.3 to 2.5 times the death rate in all age categories.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this cannot be explained by genetic differences, because if this were due to genetics, we would suppose that African Americans might lead in some, Euro-Americans might lead in some, Asian Americans might lead in some. The fact that there is such a uniform pattern of African Americans dying from these disease categories, such as hypertension and stroke, heart disease and cancer, makes me believe that this is most likely an environmental effect that is superimposed on genetic variation - which still brings us back to the idea of race-specific disease.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at something like, for example, osteoporosis, recently a pharmaceutical company marketed a drug on the idea that because Asian women and Euro-American women have a \"higher risk\" of osteoporosis, that they should take this particular drug, which gave them calcium supplements. Well, the problem with that, of course, is that even though the risk might be higher in those particular populations, there still is a risk to everyone else. And so the idea of marketing a drug on the basis of it helping some groups and not marketing it to everyone, to me, again, is an example of the fallacy of the race concept.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when genetic explanations are raised for specific diseases, most of my students will say, \"Professor Graves, but we know that sickle-cell anemia is something that only black people get,\" and the argument there also is false. The sickle-cell anemia allele is distributed throughout malaria transmission zones, which include central and western Africa but not southern Africa. It also includes the Mediterranean basin, Arabia and India.</p>\n\n<p>And so we can't find any specific disease that is found in any of those socially constructed racial groups, although different local populations may have different frequencies of genes that predispose them for disease, such as cystic fibrosis, which is found predominantly in Northern Europeans, Tay-Sachs, which is found predominantly in Jewish populations from Eastern Europe, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's another way to understand genetic differences?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The best way to understand the genetic differences that we find in human populations is that populations differ by distance. And so populations that are closer to each other geographically are more likely to share common gene variants, whereas populations that are further apart are going to share fewer genes. Human populations differ in gene frequencies relative to their geographic location. And it's a continuous change from one group to another.</p>\n\n<p>And one way we can look at this is use the example of skin color. People in the tropics tend to have darker skin. People in Norway tend to have lighter skin. If we were to only look at people in the tropics and people in Norway, we'd come to the conclusion that there's a group of people who have light skin and there's a group of people who have dark skin.</p>\n\n<p>But if we were to walk from the tropics to the Norway, what we would see is a continuous change in skin tone. And at no point along that trip would we be able to say, \"Oh, this is the place in which we go from the dark race to the light race.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between genes and environment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When we talk about the physical characteristics than an animal or a plant or a person has, those things are the product of genes. But all genes exist in an environment, and the environment always influences the expression of a given gene. Now, there are some genes that we call genes of high penetrance, which will produce their physical feature without regard to the environment we put them in. But most genes are not high penetrance genes. Most gene expression is influenced by the environment, and sometimes we can get radically different physical appearances with the same gene by making small alterations of the environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Social Darwinism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The phrase \"Social Darwinism\" is unfortunate, because it really has very little to do with the ideas of Charles Darwin. It has more to do with the ideas of Herbert Spencer, and also Charles Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Galton.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this idea caught on in America in the latter portion of the 19th century, and it was very popular with the industrial magnates who were changing American society - i.e., the Rockefellers and the Carnegies. And they thought that the person who was successful in business was an example of the end product of a social Darwinist process in which the way we judged an individual's worth was by how well he did in the American economy.</p>\n\n<p>So the robber barons were the endpoint of what the social Darwinist project was supposed to produce. And poor people or working people were the losers in the struggle for existence</p>\n\n<p>Herbert Spencer's phrase, \"survival of the fittest,\" is often mistakenly credited to Charles Darwin. What Spencer meant by that was that an individual who showed the required or desired social characteristics was the most fit in the Spencerian idea of what natural selection was supposed to be. And that's entirely different from Darwin's idea of differential reproductive success of favored genotypes in nature; they're not at all the same. And I often counsel my students that they shouldn't confuse Spencer's ideas with Darwin's ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the origin of eugenics?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Charles Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Galton, was the person who began to put a genetic component onto Spencer's idea of survival of the fittest. Galton reasoned that different types of people had different reproductive proclivities. And what Galton was worried about was that those individuals who were least intelligent and least industrious were the ones who were reproducing the most, whereas the more industrious and more highly intelligent and more socially desirable individuals were reproducing the least.</p>\n\n<p>Sir Francis Galton argued that society should step in, and in particular should support the increased reproduction of those individuals with desirable social traits, and that they should, whenever possible, retard the reproduction of individuals with the least desirable traits. The term Galton coined for this was \"eugenics.\"</p>\n\n<p>The eugenics idea caught on amongst all of the leading Euro-American intellectuals and politicians in America. It caught on amongst right-wing political figures, it also caught on amongst left-wing political figures. The right-wing political figures thought that eugenics programs were necessary to preserve, in particular, the Anglo-Saxon heritage of the United States. The left-wing political figures thought that eugenics was necessary to breed a new type of human being capable of bringing about socialist transformation of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Now, both groups were wrong since behavior doesn't directly code into genes, and it's produced by culture, not by genetic composition. But it was the right-wing political figures like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson who were in a position to influence American social policy. A number of states passed eugenical sterilization laws.</p>\n\n<p>It has been estimated that from the time that the Model American Eugenical Sterilization Law came into existence in the 1920s, that close to 68,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. Probably the best known case is the case of Carey Buck in Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>The most amazing thing about the eugenical sterilization movement is that most of the people who were sterilized were poor Euro-American people who were described as the white trash of our society. Now, the eugenicists didn't bother sterilizing African Americans or Latinos because they felt that these groups were genetically doomed anyway, so there was no need for the state to step in to stop African American reproduction.</p>\n\n<p>The Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor was set up early in the century to create a repository for suspected genetic traits And so they sent out fieldworkers to collect information on various American families and what the genetic traits exhibited in them were. Some of these things were things like the ability to play chess, rowdiness, congenital feeblemindedness, (laughter) virtually any cultural or behavior trait that you could imagine ended up in the trait book at Cold Spring Harbor.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the mistake that they were making was assuming that complex behaviors could be reduced to simple Mendelian genes, one gene produces one trait. And so they thought that by gathering this information on American families they could find out which genetic traits were linked to things like feeblemindedness and other less desirable traits, so that they could then come up with a breeding scheme to help improve the general characteristics of the Euro-American population.</p>\n\n<p>The American social and political elite supported the work at Cold Spring Harbor. They supported it not just in word but in deed. They gave millions of dollars to Charles Davenport's eugenics operation. The best way to think about the activity of the Cold Spring Harbor eugenics record office is that if we were to compare them to the type of scientific research funding that we see today, they would be as well-funded as the Human Genome project is now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the connection between American eugenics and Nazism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Eugenics Record Office was part of an international movement for eugenics in the 1930s. Most Americans do not know that the theories that the Nazi race scientists put into practice were, for the most part, pioneered by British and American eugenicists. And during this time period, there were international conventions of eugenics research in which Americans, Germans, and European eugenicists, in particular Nazi and Italian fascist eugenicists, would get together and talk about both the genetic situation in their countries and the political situation in their countries.</p>\n\n<p>Many American eugenicists were politically in favor of the fascist takeover in Europe, and envisioned similar movements in the United States, such that one American eugenicist actually participated in a Nazi eugenics court, and had the opportunity to comment on the activities of the eugenics examiners. Adolph Hitler and the Nazi propaganda machine pointed out that their eugenic policies were entirely consistent, and in fact derived from ideas of American race scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Eugenics died in the wake of the revelations of the Holocaust, the Nazi atrocities in World War II. It was interesting to note that at Nuremberg, Nazi race scientists who were brought up for crimes against humanity in those proceedings defended themselves on the claim that their activities were only mirroring the state of eugenics science in the world, and in particular they cited the activities of American eugenicists in defending themselves from prosecution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any link between race, genes and athletics?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to start with the idea that many people hold, that there is some special athletic prowess held by people of African descent in America. Most people sort of believe that African Americans are genetically predisposed to being faster runners or better basketball players or for being better cornerbacks in the National Football League. And there's also now some scientific studies which are attempting to look at population-based differences in genes that have to do with various aspects of physiological performance related to athletic ability.</p>\n\n<p>Now, at some level, when we look at human physical variation, there are some differences between human populations that could possibly relate to athletic performance. For example, if we were to look at people from northern climates, who were indigenous residents of northern climates, they tend to be short and stout instead of long or tall and lean. And there are good physical reasons for that. If you evolved in northern climates, like the Aleut or the Eskimo populations did, heat retention is facilitated by being short and stout. If you evolved in the tropics, where the environment is very hot, then heat loss is facilitated by being long and lean. So you're going to see differences in body proportions on that kind of scale.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you were to ask yourself, \"Is it likely that an Alaskan Eskimo is going to become a center in the NBA?\", well, probably not, because height has something to do with your performance at that position in the NBA. So, we can see that in the gross scale it's likely that physical differences may have something to do with various forms of athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>But when we talk about subtle things like, for example, whether a given population is going to be fastest in sprinting, then it's not so simple. The fact is that most of the world record holders in the 100-meter dash are of Western African descent, but they also tend to be African-Americans who have mixed with Europeans and American Indians. So it's not easy for us to determine whether it's being African that might have something to do with them being so fast, or whether it's the fact that they have European and American Indian ancestry that might have helped them be so fast.</p>\n\n<p>And all of those genetic factors have to be tempered in terms of the environment in which individuals train. For example, if you look at those sprinters of Western African ancestry, they all got their records because they trained in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, or even in the Caribbean. If you look at the Western African countries where those sprinters' ancestors supposedly came from, none of those countries have ever produced any world record holders in the sprint events.</p>\n\n<p>So if it was something uniquely about being African that makes you a fast sprinter, then you'd expect that Western African countries would be holding all these records too, but in fact they don't. It has something to do with genetic predisposition, it has something to do with environment, it has something to do with training regimes, and particularly at the level of world-class athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>One of the factors that shows how the situation of populations in different geographical regions influences predisposition for sport is altitude. The Kenyan success in long-distance running may have something to do with the fact that the Kalenjin Kenyans come from a high-altitude region in Kenya. But, Kenyans from low altitudes don't do well in long-distance running, so it's not something special about being a Kenyan, it's something special about living at those high altitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in the last Boston Marathon, which (laughter) someone predicted would be won by a Kalenjin Kenyan, it was in fact won by a South Korean. Now, Korea is also a mountainous country, and so it's entirely possible that this individual at least trained at high altitude. Second place was won by an Ecuadorian, which also is a mountainous country, and they also probably trained at a high altitude.</p>\n\n<p>So we have both short-term physiological adaptation that occurs from training in high altitude, and also long-term genetic adaptations for living at high altitude that might come from populations who live in those regions. And again, none of these things are consistent with our 19th century notions of race, because within the same country low-altitude Kenyans don't do well at long-distance running whereas high-altitude Kenyans do.</p>\n\n<p>So we can't come to any fast, hard rule about how genetic ancestry is going to influence the ability of an individual to perform an athletic event. I think that the simplest thing is to look at the individual's history, how hard they trained, where they got their training, what kinds of resources were put into getting them to be able to participate in world-class athletics, that it's a combination of all these things and that we'll never have a simple genetic answer that says, \"Because you came from this region of the world, you're going to dominate in swimming or long-distance running.\" I don't think we're ever going to have that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do discussions of superior athletic ability always imply inferiority in other areas, like intellect?</strong></p>\n\n<p>American society has created a mythology about the African American male in particular. If an African American male is walking on a major college campus, they are more likely to be thought of as an athlete or a coach of an athletic team than as a faculty member. On my own campus, when I walk to classes, students often come up to me and ask me if I'm the football coach or the basketball coach. And I tell them, \"No, I'm a professor in the department of life sciences.\" And when I come in to teach genetics in the fall, 99% of the Euro-American students in my class have never seen an African American professor teach a science class in the time that they've been enrolled in science courses.</p>\n\n<p>So we have a social history of believing that African Americans cannot perform intellectually. When most Americans see African Americans it's in the context of sports and entertainment. If you look at television shows and the television coverage of African Americans, what most Americans see on the news at night, is African Americans in sports - and unfortunately recently it's been African American sports figures in trouble with the law - and it's been African Americans in entertainment or it's been African Americans in comedy. So we sort of go back to the history of the minstrel show, in terms of the way that the African American is treated in American social life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How have the groups that dominate certain sports changed over time?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the funny things about athleticism and sports is how the expectations of athletic performance change through the years. For example, in the '60s, everyone thought that Africans were fast, and so they expected African Americans to win sprint events, but that the long-distance events were all going to be won by Europeans or Middle Easterners. Then the Kenyans came along and began to dominate long-distance track and field.</p>\n\n<p>When professional basketball first began, one of the best teams was made up of mainly Eastern European Jews, and it was said that the reason why they were so good at basketball was because the \"artful dodger\" characteristic of the Jewish culture made them good at this sport.</p>\n\n<p>There were also, in boxing, at the turn of the century, a lot of European immigrant groups, particularly Irish, who were important in boxing [as well as Jews]. And that has changed. In sprinting, track and field events, it was said that Africans and African Americans were fast and so they could run the short distances but the long distances belonged to Europeans. But then again, the Kenyans came along and blew that theory out of the water.</p>\n\n<p>And so we even see today sports that have been traditionally dominated by people of upper middle class backgrounds, like tennis and golf - the arrival of the Williams sisters in tennis and Tiger Woods in golf - has made some people think that there's something general about being African or African American descent that makes you excellent in athletics.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the history shows us that as opportunities change in society, different groups get drawn into sporting arenas and depending upon, again, opportunity and training, along with individual motivation, that determines who becomes the champion. I don't think it's so much genetic predisposition from some particular region of the world, and certainly it's not race, because as we pointed out in this program that there are no biological races in the human species.</p>\n\n<p>So we have seen, particularly in professional athletics over the last couple of decades, a change in its composition. In the 1950s, social discrimination barred African American athletes from pursuing a career in baseball, in football, in basketball. And now that discrimination has been removed and people with athletic ability of all ethnicities have had a chance to enter sports, and in that time period African Americans now have excelled. Some people argue that this is necessarily a result of the genetic superiority of the African American athlete.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that we don't know this, and, in fact, again, it would be difficult to make that claim based upon all of the things that are required for someone to excel in a given sport. Also, football, basketball, and baseball, are not the only sports in America. If we look at other sports, such as, for example, soccer or lacrosse or volleyball, we don't see African Americans dominating those sports. It takes just as much athletic ability to do well in those sports as in baseball, basketball, and football.</p>\n\n<p>So there are strong cultural aspects of what sports individuals choose to play, along with access and training that have something to do with one's performance. So I don't think we're ever going to be able to isolate the African American gene for athletic performance. I don't think such a gene exists. Given what we know about the overlap of populations and genetic composition, I think it's highly unlikely that that alone would be explaining differences in sports prowess.</p>\n\n<p>It has to do with the interaction of individual genetic background, of opportunity, and training, and I think we should get used to the idea that that's what we're going to know, and we shouldn't be worried about the fact that we can't locate the athletic gene.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your personal experience with regard to racial classification?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, during the census, a census worker came to my house and wanted to take data about the racial composition of the people who lived there. I opened the door and she asked me, \"Well, you know, how do you describe yourself racially?\" And I looked at the form and said, \"Well, based upon the form you have here, the best thing that I would be described as is African American, or black.\" And so she clicked the \"black\" box, and then asked me, \"Well, how many other people live here?\" I said, \"My wife and our two children.\"</p>\n\n<p>So she immediately went in to block in \"black\" for my wife and children. I said, \"No, you didn't ask me what my wife's ethnicity was.\" And at that point she took two steps back from the door and asked me, \"Well, what would you describe your wife as,\" and I said, \"Looking at the categories, you don't really have a category for my wife here. She's Korean, and based upon what you have here, Asian is the best guess.\"</p>\n\n<p>And then she then asked, \"Well, how would you describe your kids?\" as she was about to check the black category. And I told her, \"Well, you just asked me what my wife was and I told you she was Korean, so how do you come to the conclusion that my kids are black?\" At that point she took another step back from the door. And I said, \"Well, based upon the categories you have, you're going to have to describe my kids as other.\"</p>\n\n<p>And the \"other\" category sort of describes what we go through on a daily basis: when the children are with my wife, people think that they're Asian. Both my sons play piano, and when they're in piano recitals, people think that they're Asian. However when they're in sports and with me, playing basketball, they talk about my son's natural athletic ability, and they think he's black.</p>\n\n<p>So here you have children who have a mixed ancestry who are racially defined by which parent they're seen with and which activity they're involved in, which match the stereotypical views of people about what racial groups are supposed to do.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"605cc37e-9f28-438a-b7e0-c5b7976597a3","name":"Science: Genetics","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Phenotype","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Scientific and Folk Ideas About Heredity","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>We make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/c51cd4ffaef17f2448fdce30f36ec797-bb1c2ef684bb0489a2511453032a3e2d.png"}}}},{"title":"Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Our eyes tell us that people look different.

Sub-Saharan Africans have dark skin and people who live in East Asia tend to have a light tan skin and an eye color and eye shape and hair that is different than Europeans. So there is this kind of genetic - it is genetic - differentiation of some features of the body between people who live in Central Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America.</p>\n\n<p>And those features, which are geographically determined, were used to erect notions of different races. There's the African race, the Black race, the Yellow race, the Red race, the Brown race, and the White race. And it's mostly skin color plus hair shape and eye shape and so on. That's the everyday observation, that “they” all look alike - and we all look different.</p>\n\n<p>The real question is not whether those differences in skin color and hair form are genetic because they are. We know that because the children of black slaves brought to North America were the same color as their parents were. The question is what else does that tell us about biological differences? How much difference in other genes beside the genes that are relevant to skin color is there between these major geographical groups?</p>\n\n<p>If we want to use the notion of race in a sensible, biological way, we could only do that if there really were a lot of genetic difference between those groups aside from the superficial differences that we can see. And that's an important issue which we now understand. We understand it because over the years a lot of data were gathered by anthropologists and geneticists looking at blood group genes and protein genes and other kinds of genes from all over the world. Anthropologists just went around taking blood out of everybody.</p>\n\n<p>I must say, if I were a South American Indian, I wouldn't have let them take my blood, but they did. And one of the consequences of that is by the early 1970s, we had a huge amount of information about the different genetic forms all over the world for a large number of genes that had no relevance to those outward manifestations like skin color, but had to do with blood type and proteins.</p>\n\n<p>And when you brought all that together, it became pretty clear that there really were minor differences in the frequencies of the different gene forms between the major geographical so-called races.</p>\n\n<p>Since the 20th century, it's been recognized that there's what's called polymorphism of blood type. There are type As and type Bs and type Os and Rh-positive and Rh-negative and so on in every group in the world. But the assumption was that people in Africa would have a very different relative frequency of A and B and O than people would in North America or in Europe and in Asia.</p>\n\n<p>And what all these studies showed was that that wasn't true. That you couldn't really tell the difference between an African population and a European population and an Asian population by looking at the frequency, the relative proportions of the different blood types. They were essentially the same in all these groups.</p>\n\n<p>That isn't true for every blood type. There are occasional types which are strongly differentiated between populations. There's one blood type called the Duffy blood type and that's very different between Asians, Africans, and Europeans. But that's an exception rather than a rule.</p>\n\n<p>For almost every gene we know, either everybody in the world has the same form of the gene, in which case all human beings are the same, or if there's variation, the frequencies of the different variants are the same relatively speaking, close to the same, in Africans, Asians, North Americans, Austro-Asians, and so on. And only about - well, I estimated 7% of all of human genetic variation could be ascribed to differences between groups, between major races. Anyway, about 75% of all the genes [come in only one form and] are identical in everybody. So there's very little differentiation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you measure human genetic variation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The way we measure human variation genetically is to look and find all the different forms of a particular gene, the alternative forms of a gene, and then see what percentage of the population has form one, form two, form three, form four, form five, and so on. Now if 99% of the population has one form and only 1% has another then there isn't much genetic variation in the population for that. And if different populations all have 99% of form one and 1% of form two, then there's no differentiation between populations because they have all the same percentages.</p>\n\n<p>If on the other hand one population had 99% of form one and 1% of form two but some other population had 99% of form two and only 1% of form one, then even though within the population almost everybody is the same, between the populations there'd be a big difference.</p>\n\n<p>So that's the way you characterize it. You see the percentages of the different forms in different populations and you ask -- If I take a sample from one population, are proportions of the different forms similar whether it's an African population or an Asian population or a European population? If so, there's no difference BETWEEN populations, and all the difference is found WITHIN populations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what did you discover about population differences?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, the problem back then for evolutionists and population geneticists was always to try to actually characterize how much genetic variation there was between individuals and groups and so on. And nobody knew how to do that because you had to connect genes with some outward manifestation that you could actually observe, and most genes don't have an outward manifestation in their variation.</p>\n\n<p>So people didn't really know whether individuals varied genetically a lot from one another or only a little bit. They could see variation between individuals but they didn't know how much of all the genes that variation represented. And for a very long time, nobody had the faintest idea how genetically variable our species was from individual to individual.</p>\n\n<p>And I spent a lot of time worrying about that like other people in my profession. And then I met a guy who had an experimental gimmick and he didn't know what to do with it, but I knew what to do with it. So I was sort of a person with a problem without a method and he was a guy with a method without a problem and we got together.</p>\n\n<p>And that method was essentially to extract proteins from individuals and to run them in an electric field and to see whether the proteins moved at different rates in an electric field. If there were alternative forms of the genes that were for that protein, then the proteins would move at a different rate in the electric field, and you could visually identify the proteins by staining them.</p>\n\n<p>So what you did is you ground up a fruit fly, you stuck it in a slab of jello, you turned on the current, all the proteins moved in the jello, and you turned off the current. You stained it, and sure enough you would see that different individuals had the same protein moving different distances. And that would be because they had a different form of the same gene.</p>\n\n<p>And that method, which is called gel electrophoresis, a very fancy name, we were able to use it on any organism at all. If you could grind it up, you could do it, and that included people. You didn't have to grind up the whole person, but you could take a little bit of tissue or blood; you could do it on flies, on mice, on plants, on bacteria, anything. And the result was for 20 years people interested in this question of genetic variation were grinding up organisms and measuring the genetic variation.</p>\n\n<p>And what they discovered was that organisms within a species were tremendously genetically different one from another. Many people had said, \"No, they're all the same because any genetic differences are mutations and they will be selected out by natural selection. And except for a few superficial differences, everybody in a species is the same.\"</p>\n\n<p>But that's not true. It turns out that between 25-33% of genes within a species are of the variable kind. They differ from one individual to another. And that's what that method discovered, that something around a quarter or a third of all your genes -- not your genes, but genes of any organism -- are variable between individuals of the species. So that gave us a different view of the possibility of evolution. And I thought, \"Well, this raises the possibility that we could ask how much genetic differentiation there is between humans in different population groups.\"</p>\n\n<p>It had already been established by a guy named Harry Harris that there was a lot of this genetic variation in humans, the kind that we have found in fruit flies, that people have found in plants. He used the same technique and showed that humans are genetically variable. But what he didn't know was how much difference there was between Africans and Asians and Europeans and so on. But a certain amount of that data began to accumulate, and by 1972 a lot of those data existed.</p>\n\n<p>We could then tell from older data on human blood groups, which were known for a long time, and from this more recent data on their proteins which we could visualize in these gels, how much difference there was between any two individuals genetically and between a collection of individuals from France and a collection of individuals from French Equatorial Africa, and from Asia. And that collection of data is now huge, I mean, we know an immense amount about that kind of protein variation in humans. That was before people were sequencing DNA. That's when we were just looking at people's proteins.</p>\n\n<p>And so I thought, \"Well, we've got enough of this data, let's see what it tells us about the differences between human groups.\" And so I just looked into the literature, and that literature was in books and so on. And so one day I was going to give a lecture, I think it was in Carbondale, Illinois, or somewhere south. I was working in Chicago at the time. So I took a couple of these books with me and a pad of paper, and a table of logarithms which I needed for this purpose, and a little hand calculator, and I sat on this bus trip for three or four hours looking at the books, picking out the data, looking it up in the table of logarithms, doing a calculation, and writing it down in tables.</p>\n\n<p>And when I got back after the round trip I had all the data I needed to write the paper about how much human genetic variation there was, and so I did it. And that's been repeated in recent years using DNA and so on. You always get the same result. Shows you it's worthwhile being afraid to fly, by the way, because you have lots of time on a bus to work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So how much difference is there between human groups?</strong></p>\n\n<p>And the numbers come out as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Roughly speaking for human beings, for about three-quarters of all our genes, everybody in the world, except a rare individual, has only one form of the gene. So all human beings share that form. For the 25%-33% or so of those genes for which there is some variation - 99 to one or 50/50 or 75/25 of different forms - for almost all of those genes, it doesn't matter from which population you take the sample; they have the same proportions. That is to say, if it's 75% of Form One and 25% of Form Two in Europeans, it's 70% of Form One and 30% of Form Two in Africans and 73% of Form One and 27% of Form Two in Asians, and so on. Most genes are like that.</p>\n\n<p>But there are a very few genes, like the Duffy blood group, in which in Asian populations there is one very common form, in African populations there are two forms, but they're not the same as the common one in Asians, and in Europeans there's another different ratio. So for that gene, there's a big difference in the frequencies, but that's rare.</p>\n\n<p>And if you put it all together - and we've now done that for proteins, for blood groups, and now with DNA sequencing, we have it for DNA sequence differences - it always comes out the same: 85% of all the variation among human beings is between any two individuals WITHIN any local population, 85% of all the variation; please remember that 75% of all genes are identical for everybody. But of the variation there is, 85% of that is between individuals within Sweden or within Denmark or within the Ewee or the Ki-kuyu or the Chinese or something.</p>\n\n<p>Of the remaining 15% of human variation, it's roughly a 50/50 split of the variation between nationalities within what used to be called a major race, between Swedes, Italians, French, and so on, or between Ewee and Ki-kuyu and Zulu or something. And the other remaining 7% or so is between those major groups -- the blacks, browns, yellows, red, and whites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does that tell us about race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, it might have turned out that there were big genetic differences between groups, and that most genes were highly differentiated between the major races. Now, if that turned out to be true, then at least it would be a possibility, although not demonstrated, that there might be, as some like to dream, high differentiations between groups in their mental abilities or in their temperaments or anything like that. Although nobody knew about any genes for those things, at least it was a living possibility.</p>\n\n<p>But when we found that there were practically no genetic differences between groups except skin color and body form and a few things like that, it became a great deal less likely and less interesting to talk about genetic differences between groups. And the consequence is that from the biological standpoint those major so-called races - black, brown, yellow, white, and red - were not biologically interesting.</p>\n\n<p>And that, in turn, meant that the differences that people were constantly emphasizing for social purposes were social constructs which almost certainly didn't have any biological basis. And therefore we should stop talking about major races because to talk about major races gave the impression that there were big differences between these groups in things that mattered - I mean, skin color, after all, doesn't matter except in some vague aesthetic sense - but things that really mattered: people's characters, their intelligence, their behavior, whether they're going to compete with other people or not and so on. The evidence then became that there weren't any interesting differences in such things, and so we should stop talking about race.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What causes different skin colors?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, the fact of the matter is that geneticists don't know anything about the genes that influence most characteristics of human interest. In fact, we don't even know where and how many genes there are that influence skin color - which is certainly influenced by genes, we know that. We don't know how many genes there are. We don't know where they are. We don't know anything about genes for schizophrenia or manic depression or dependency on drugs. Nothing. Zero. People keep making claims, and they take them back again.</p>\n\n<p>Now why it is that people in these different groups evolved different skin colors is an open question. Nobody knows that. People have tried to tell us stories about it - stories like, well if you live where there's a lot of sun it's a good thing to have black skin so you wouldn't get skin cancer. But that really doesn't work, because it is true, you're more likely to get skin cancer if you get a lot of sun and you don't have dark skin, but that skin cancer doesn't come on until you're past your reproductive age anyway. So that wouldn't have any effect on your evolution.</p>\n\n<p>The best guess these days is that the reason that people have different hair forms and eye shapes and skin colors, those outward manifestations, is something that Darwin called sexual selection. For some crazy reason which I can't understand, people in Europe liked washed-out looking people and they tended to select them for their mates, and the consequence is the Europeans became washed-out looking. Whereas people in Africa preferred dark people and so they became dark just by selective mating. And it would be exactly those outward manifestations like eye shape and hair shape and skin color that would have that effect.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody can select their mate on the basis of blood group because you don't know what your mate's blood group is. So for those things which couldn't be subject to this kind of visual selection, mating selection, no differentiation occurred.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do people still hold on to biological explanations of difference?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, first of all, race is a social reality. I mean, there are people who are dark skinned and they are called black, and that's a social reality. You can't deny that. The question is why people hold onto that social reality. There are two reasons, one optimistic one, mainly that just because an idea changes or is seen to be without a basis, it doesn't go away right away. It takes time as human generations go on.</p>\n\n<p>But more than that, race and racial categorizations serve a very important social function, namely, they justify the inequalities that exist in a society which is said to be based on equality. Why is it that if all men are created equal - not women, notice, but men - if all men are created equal, then why is there a much greater proportion of black people in jail than white people?</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that people are not treating them fairly? \"No,\" you say, \"that can't be, because we live in a society of equality.\" So the easy answer is, \"Well, they're in jail because more black people ought to be in jail because black people have genes that make them criminals.\" And the beauty of that ideology that it justifies what is the greatest social agony of American life, certainly, and partly, European life - namely, the huge social inequalities between groups in a society which claims to be a society of equality.</p>\n\n<p>And you have to cope with that, you have to somehow become at ease with it, because the alternative is to demand a real revolution in social relations, and that's not easy to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is biological determinism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Biological determinism is this notion that everything that's important about human beings and the differences between them and their position in the world is determined internally by their biological natures. And I think in our world, the importance of biological determinism really goes back to the American Revolution and the notion that we were going to build a society of equality. \"All men are created equal; they're endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, etc.\"</p>\n\n<p>And the problem with that is, you look around and you see people don't have equality of wealth or power or status. And the problem then, is to explain how it is that in a society which is supposed to be built on equality there's so much inequality. And that was a problem that also bothered the English as well and the French in the 19th century; everybody was concerned with explaining tremendous social inequalities despite the fact that they were living in these societies which revolutions had occurred to make equality.</p>\n\n<p>And there are really only two solutions to that problem. Either it was all fake to begin with - maybe the revolutions weren't really meant to produce equality; they were just meant to get some people in power instead of the old people - or the alternative is people are as equal as they can be. The reason they're not more equal is because there are in-built, unchangeable, blood-determined differences between them. (When they said blood, now we talk about genes. But it's the same thing.) Society has just equalized as much as it can and the people now who are in superior position are there because of their biological natures.</p>\n\n<p>So that social stratification, social differences, difference in status, wealth, and power are all largely a consequence of your biological nature, which is unchangeable. And that's what biological determinism is. The structure of society is fixed, and it's fixed for biological reasons.</p>\n\n<p>And then there's another side to it. And the other side is you say, \"Well okay, suppose it's really true that there are unchangeable differences between individuals. Some people by their biology could be professors and others could be only janitors.\" You could say, \"Alright, I'll accept that, but maybe we should have a society in which both professors and janitors who are all doing socially useful work, I guess, are rewarded equally. Why should society give differential rewards just because some people can do one thing and other people can do another?\"</p>\n\n<p>And then we have a new form of biological determinism, the kind of thing you see in evolutionary psychology and socio-biology, which says, \"Well, but it's part of biological human nature to create hierarchical societies.\" So it's impossible biologically to make a society in which everybody gets equal status and wealth and power because they'll naturally create this hierarchies.</p>\n\n<p>So biological determinism these days really has two forms, two aspects. One is that the differences between us are biologically determined and the second is that we all are similar in one very important respect, namely we all have human nature, and that human nature makes us produce hierarchical societies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between your DNA and how you turn out as a person?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The word that geneticists use for a description of your outward manifestations and your physiology and your metabolism and your anatomy and so on, including your behavior, is phenotype - literally, \"what appears,\" from the notion of pheno, to appear. And in theory that's supposed to be the result of the genes that you have, which are called the genotype.</p>\n\n<p>The question that geneticists have been struggling with for a very long time is, What's the relationship between those elements in the genotype, the DNA, and what comes out at the end of the developmental process, the phenotype?</p>\n\n<p>You have to remember, we start as a fertilized egg, and that egg goes through cell divisions and becomes a whole organism, and that organism develops throughout its entire life. We are all developing continuously. We get taller and then we get shorter. We get smarter and then we get dumber. That happens continuously.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is, What's the relationship between those inner elements, those genes, the genotype, and the phenotype. And the answer that we know from years of experimental study and ordinary observation is that there's no simple one-to-one relationship between the genotype and the phenotype. The organism is certainly influenced in powerful ways by the genes - there is no chimpanzee that will be interviewed on television and say the things I'm saying now, because chimpanzees don't have the genes to enable them to speak, to form these abstract ideas, because their brains are not the right shape and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So clearly differences between the species are, in some sense, in the genes. But at the same time it's not the case that every aspect of the phenotype is determined by the genes, because the environment in which you develop, both within the womb and after you're born, your whole psychic environment, your education, what comes in on you, the food you eat, the society you live in - all that goes to form the phenotype.</p>\n\n<p>That phenotype can't be anything in the world. As I said, no matter what environment a chimpanzee lives in it'll never be a professor, although some professors might be sort of like chimpanzees. No matter what environment we live in, I think it's extremely unlikely that human beings will live to be 200 years old, for example, because of our genes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what's interesting about our phenotypes, about the variation of phenotypes between individuals, is that they sort of vary continuously - like heights or shapes or colors - there's not just three different colors or four different heights, yet the genes exist as discrete objects which have particular different forms. You can have form one of the gene or form two of the gene or form three.</p>\n\n<p>So you have these discreet differences at the genotypic level, which are somehow converted into continuous variation between individuals and their behavior and their morphology and their physiology, and it's kind of like a pointillist painting, in which, if you stand back from the painting, you see continuous figures, but when you go up close to them you see that they're made by tiny little dots of paint which fuse together in your eyes and in your brain from a distance, but are discreet and individual.</p>\n\n<p>And the observer who observers a pointillist painting is performing an action, is making the phenotype out of that underlying genotype, so to speak, by the intervention of their eyes and their central nervous systems. In the same way, our genotype is converted into a phenotype through the developmental process which is occurring in a particular environment. And every environment is different, and environments are changing all the time.</p>\n\n<p>So there's a very complicated relationship between genotype and phenotype. People who say, \"Well, if only I knew all your genes I'd know exactly all about you,\" are wrong. Indeed, the notion that if I cloned an individual by reproducing that person's genes in another individual, that the cloned individual would be identical with the ones from which the genes came, is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>When I was a child, the most famous people in the world were the Dionne Quintuplets. The Quintuplets were five girls born in rural Quebec, all identical quintuplets. And they were dressed alike and they had their hair done alike and they looked alike, and they were put into a kind of zoo by their parents and by the doctor who delivered them and by the province of Ontario. And everybody looked at them and they were made as alike as they could be so they'd be the wonder of the modern age. They were clones of each other.</p>\n\n<p>But in fact, when they got older, when they left this artificial environment, they became quite different from each other. A couple became nuns, some were married and some not, two died and three are still alive - I think a third one died recently. One was schizophrenic, the others weren't. They were as different from each other as any five girls could be, although they still looked pretty much alike.</p>\n\n<p>And that's the important point: that although a lot of our morphology, a lot of our facial features appear not to be greatly influenced by environmental variation, our personalities clearly are tremendously influenced by it, and our abilities. And the Dionne quintuplets are a wonderful example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it possible that genes could hold the key to social behaviors?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People are always talking about genes for things - the genes for athletic ability, the genes for making money, the genes for intelligence. And you have to be very careful. Even when there are genes that influence those things, to talk about them as genes for that is not so clear. And a friend of mine gave me a wonderful example. He said, \"I know where the genes for knitting are.\" And I said, \"How can you know where those genes are; what does that mean?\"</p>\n\n<p>And he said, \"Oh, the genes for knitting are clearly on the X chromosome, the sex chromosome. Why? Because, after all, all the people I know who knit have two x chromosomes, and everybody I know who has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome doesn't knit, so the gene for knitting has to be on the X chromosome.\" And he's right, by the way, that that's the standard method used by geneticists: you find some genetic marker and you see that everybody who has that genetic marker has this trait, everybody who has a different genetic marker has another trait, so you've discovered the gene for it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I say the gene for knitting, you're going to laugh, you're going to say, \"That's silly. There can't be a gene for knitting. I know why people knit.\" And the reason that we laugh is because we know the whole story about the gene for knitting. We know that the genes on the X and Y chromosome are for plumbing, and X chromosome people have one kind of plumbing and people with a Y chromosome have a different kind of plumbing. Depending on which plumbing you're born with, you're socialized as either a female or a male. And if you're socialized as a female, one of the things you learn to do is to knit, and if you're socialized as a male, you don't learn to knit.</p>\n\n<p>So, of course, people with two X chromosomes knit and people with one X and one Y don't knit. But you wouldn't want to say that the genes for knitting are there. The point is, we understand the complete developmental and social story about why people with two X chromosomes knit and people with one X and one Y chromosome don't knit. And what's nice about that story is it was exactly the opposite in the 18th century. In the 18th century the gene for knitting was on the Y chromosome, because only men did hand-knitting, not women!</p>\n\n<p>And the reason why men gave up hand-knitting and left it their wives to do at home is because someone invented the knitting machine and the men went into the factory and did knitting on knitting machines and left the now economically useless work to their wives at home. So maybe what we should say that we know that the X chromosome has the genes for doing economically useless work, and the Y chromosome for doing economically useful work.</p>\n\n<p>When you put it in those terms, when you really know the complete story, you stop talking about genes for this and genes for that, and you talk about genes having some influence on certain physiological anatomical traits, which are then used as cues by other people.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's talk about race. I know where the genes for being incarcerated are. They're the skin color genes. Now, that doesn't mean that those genes cause you to be incarcerated. What those genes do is to cause you to have a certain skin color, and social relations and social arrangements are such that people who have dark skin color are incarcerated more than people who don't have dark skin color, but the genes don't make you incarcerated. You have to make that distinction very clearly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you think about new trends in genetics research?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The so-called \"new genetics\", which just puts the action of these biological factors onto a molecular scale, is still as deterministic as ever. People who are doing molecular genetics, who are mapping genes in human beings, are trying to find the genes for schizophrenia, the genes that are responsible for all sorts of diseases.</p>\n\n<p>The editor of Science magazine, the most prestigious general science magazine, once was asked why we should spend a lot of money on the human genome project when we have all those poor people and homeless people out there, and his response was, \"The best way to get rid of homelessness is to study people's genes because homelessness is in the genes.\"</p>\n\n<p>So the genome project and molecular genetics are simply a new manifestation of an old idea - or they're created with that same bias, namely, the reason we're studying all the genes is because genes determine everything. If you didn't think genes determined what was really important in life, then why would you go and spend all this money and time studying the human genome?</p>\n\n<p>Look, people said, when the human genome project was floated, once we know what the human genome is, when we see all the genes, we'll know what it is to be human. A very famous biologist said that. So if you really think you'll learn what it is to be human by studying human genes, that's why you study them. But of course, we won't know what it is to be human by studying the genes. That's the error. But nevertheless, that's what the modern manifestation of biological determinism is.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take the argument [about genes and homelessness] as the editor meant it. What he's saying is, Why are people homeless? Many homeless people are de-institutionalized mentally ill people or people who have been on drugs or things of that kind. Why are they on drugs? Because they have a biological dependency on drugs. Why are they mentally ill? Because they have genes that make them mentally ill. So that was his reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Homelessness is not, for him, simply the usual manifestation of economic inequality. People who are homeless are homeless because they're in one way or the other sick, and knowing the genes will cure all the diseases. That's his claim. Especially drug dependency, schizophrenia, manic depression, and so forth. They're all due to genes according to that view. Of course, people have been struggling to find the genes for schizophrenia and manic-depressive syndrome for a long time and they haven't found them. Or rather, they keep planning to find them and then six months later they write a paper saying, \"Oh, we made a mistake. They're not there.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is biological determinism another form of racism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Biological racism is just another manifestation of the belief that everything is in the genes. So of course, if people in Africa are not as well off as people in Europe, it's because they have genes that make them less intelligent and less ambitious, and so on. And the beauty of the race business is that you can identify people by just looking at them. You don't even have to look at their genes because one manifestation of their genes is there - namely skin color or eye shape or hair shape - and then that's the key to everything.</p>\n\n<p>So racism, that kind of biological racism is just part of the general ideology that everything important is in the genes. And of course, if people look different then they must have different genes, and to some extent they do have different genes. And that will explain why slaves were black and masters were white. So racism is part and parcel of that whole thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do our ideas of biological determinism come from?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Biological determinism, which is a desire to understand social inequality, was really built into most 19th century English literature. Dickens, whose the great mystery novelist of the 19th century - all of his mysteries are about the same thing: How do we explain the character people have? Is it upbringing or is it internal? And he believed it was internal.</p>\n\n<p>Oliver Twist is the most famous example of that. You have to remember Oliver Twist was born in the workhouse, which was the place you had to go to get relief after the New Poor Law of 1834. And his mother was in the workhouse. He was born in the workhouse, he had no education, he was living with all these other kids on gruel, picking oakum, doing all the things that little kids in the workhouse did.</p>\n\n<p>And then when he left the workhouse without any education, without any culture, without anything, we find him on the road to London. And he meets on the road to London the Artful Dodger, a kid somewhat older than he was, a teenager. And the contrast between Oliver and the Artful Dodger which is drawn by Dickens is extraordinary. Because the Artful Dodger doesn't speak good English; he drops all his G's; that's the thing that you would expect a poor kid from the slums of London to do. And here's Oliver; he's described as a delicate child, he uses the subjunctive, his grammar is perfect. Where did he learn all that - in the workhouse, the most degraded institution of 19th century Britain?</p>\n\n<p>Well, that's the mystery. The mystery of Oliver Twist is how do we explain the contrast in character between Oliver Twist on the one hand and the Artful Dodger on the other, both of whom were brought up under essentially the same miserable circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>And at the end of the book you discover that Oliver actually had upper-middle class parents. And even though he never saw them because his mother died in childbirth and he never saw his father, the true nature of that upper-middle class \"blood\" came out in him, and so he was a child of great moral character. He was honest, he was delicate, he used good English, and so on. And that was a working out of that notion, that what really matters about character is what's inside, not what's outside.</p>\n\n<p>And he's not the only one. There's the wonderful story of George Elliott, Daniel Deronda, one of George Elliott's heroes. We're told right away he's the adopted son of an English baroness, and he has all the behavior of the young lord. We meet him in a fashionable watering place and gambling casino in Germany.</p>\n\n<p>And then mysteriously around the age of 20 or 21, he falls in love with a Jewish woman. Now this is early 19th century Britain. That doesn't happen every day of the week. The baron falls in love with a Jewish woman. He learns the Talmud, he converts, and he becomes a Zionist; he actually is one of the earliest people to want to go to Palestine. What's the secret? How do you understand that strange business?</p>\n\n<p>It turns out - and you only discover this at the end of the book - that his mother is a famous Jewish actress who he finally meets when he's an adult and it all came through, and he became what his genes made him. So Dickens is not the only one. And that's true in French literature, it's true in all literature of the 19th century.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aren't groups like Icelanders genetically distinct because they've been more isolated?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Iceland has been in the news a lot recently because the Icelandic government has awarded the entire Icelandic genome to a private company to exploit. The claim of this company is that the reason why they want to have the genotypes of all Icelanders is because Icelanders are uniquely homogenous people. And why are they uniquely homogenous? Because, the story is, Iceland was founded in the 9th century by people who came from Norway - a very small number of people who came from Norway, just these immigrants. There was nobody in Iceland when they arrived - that's true - and all Icelanders at the present time are descended from those few immigrants at the very beginning, and therefore Icelanders are all related to each other very closely, and therefore if somehow we could study their genes we could find the genes for disease and other things because everybody's related to everybody, and we could carry out the pedigree.</p>\n\n<p>And so the whole thing is based on the claim that Iceland is extremely homogenous, genetically. Now, that's bolstered by the fact that Icelanders speak a language which elsewhere has been dead for 1500 years; that is to say, they speak a form of Old Norse which is related to Norwegian and Swedish but very different. And also they are claimed all to look alike - they're all sort of reddish-haired or blond and so on - and they're isolated and they all know each other; it's a very small country, only a couple hundred thousand people.</p>\n\n<p>So all of that comes together, this notion that Iceland is a genetic isolate, a few people came there, they've been genetically isolated from everybody ever since, and that's why they speak this crazy language and everything is homogenous.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the trouble is that we know that that's not true, and we know it from a source which is in one sense the source of Icelandic national pride, which is the Icelandic Sagas. The Icelandic Sagas, which were composed or spoken verbally during the Middle Ages by a variety of Icelandic authors and eventually written down, tell us the story of the founding of Iceland, of the wars that the Icelanders, the Vikings, engaged in.</p>\n\n<p>And they give this impression at first that it's a very homogenous society. But when you begin to read the sagas, what you discover is that those early Icelanders, those Vikings, were in fact making a living doing exactly the same thing that the Ancient Greeks were doing: namely, half the time they spent farming, and then half the time they were pirates. They got in their boats, and they went around raping and pillaging and taking slaves and just warring everywhere, and that's what Vikings were. Vikings were pirates. And they didn't try to excuse it; that was the way of life the Sagas described.</p>\n\n<p>And in the process of that piratical existence, they took slaves, they brought people back to Iceland from other countries. There a wonderful place in I think it's Egil's Saga, which is a story of a guy who wants to buy a concubine. So he goes to Russia and he deals with a Russian trader, and the Russian trader asks him a certain price for this concubine. He said he had a dozen of these women in his hut. And the Icelander says, \"Wait a minute, I'm not going to pay that. That's much more than the usual price for a woman slave.\"</p>\n\n<p>So there was a usual price, which meant that Icelanders were doing this all the time. They were getting women and bringing them back. If you look around northern Scotland, you see lots of town names - this \"ness\" and that \"ness\" - Loch Ness, Inverness, so on. Ness is an Iceland word; it means cape. Those are all the places the Icelanders landed and took their slaves. One of the sagas is all about the fighting in the Orkney Islands and how the Icelanders landed in the Orkneys and established their position there and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So Iceland, in fact, is a place made up, yes, partly of descendants of those early Viking ancestors who fled from Norway to escape the king, but in large part also from slaves they took, from people they brought from all over, and became part of the Icelandic genetic pool. So Iceland turns out, in fact, when you look at Icelanders, when you look at their proteins, you look at their DNA, they turn out to be not any more genetically homogenous than Swedes, Germans, English, French, all of Northern Europe. They look like a typical Northern European country.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"605cc37e-9f28-438a-b7e0-c5b7976597a3","name":"Science: Genetics","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Biological Determinism","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Genetics","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Why Humans haven't Evolved into Subspecies","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/1e294a9de8ff0733cf4c5e21bff265eb-cd24700e7e40476025f4c1c63f8f5bf1.jpg"}}}},{"title":"A Racialized Medical Genomics: Shiny, Bright and Wrong","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>End racist practices, end economic exploitation, and everybody's health improves.

But the idea is that there's a small number of basically different flavors of people, perhaps color-coded for your convenience: yellow, white, red, black. That's the common sense understanding of race.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't reflect natural patterns of variation, because of course, the peoples of Africa are exceedingly diverse, the peoples of Asia are exceedingly diverse, and the peoples of Europe, of course, are exceedingly diverse, as well.</p>\n\n<p>So it's not that we're reading natural patterns of variation and simply extracting this idea from nature, but what we're doing is we're deciding that certain patterns of variation are less important that others, and certain patterns of variation are more important that others. We decide that the difference between a Norwegian and an Italian is not significant and so we'll place them in the same category. And we decide that the difference between a Persian and a Somali is important, and so we'll place them in different categories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does genetics tell us about human variation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The modern study of genetic variation, since about the 1970s, tells us essentially that people are similar to those nearby and they're different from those far away. And that no more tells us that there's three kinds of people than it tells us there are seven, or twelve, or thirty-eight kinds of people. Most genetic variation is encapsulated within any local group - that is to say, all human groups have people that are taller, or shorter, or heavier, or skinnier, or more extroverted or more introverted.</p>\n\n<p>So the range of different kinds of people are found within all groups and what genetics was able to do was to put a number on that. About 85% of detectable genetic variation is located within groups. To the extent that there is between-group variation, the majority of between-group variation is local, not racial. And the amount of difference attributable to this large group of people versus that large group of people is only a tiny portion of the total of human variation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What accounts for our patterns of variation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The peoples of east Africa look different from the peoples of western Africa, who look different from the peoples of South Africa. And in fact, the peoples of east Africa look more like the peoples of west Asia, and are genetically more similar to the peoples of west Asia than they are to the peoples of western Africa. Why is that? Because they're closer. And the major variable determining biological similarity and biological difference is geographical proximity. Why? Because people interbreed with one another. And when human groups come into contact with each other, what Cole Porter called \"the urge to merge\" has invariably expressed itself. It didn't start with Columbus. It's been going on through time immemorial.</p>\n\n<p>Neighboring groups always have complex economic and social relationships with their neighbors, and obviously they marry their neighbors and they have complex forms of what anthropologists used to sexistly call \"bride exchange.\" We may hate the people next door, but we're related to them. Why? Because our ancestors interbred.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout European history we certainly know about all kinds of migrations and invasions and dispersions. We know less about the history of pre-colonial Africa, because we have less preserved in writing, but that certainly doesn't mean that people were just sitting there in one place. Obviously people were migrating and people were moving and the history of populations is a dynamic, flowing continuum. And that's why the patterns that we discovered genetically - the continuity of form, and the continuity of populations from place to place exists - because people are always moving and interbreeding and intermarrying.</p>\n\n<p>There's two major kinds of gene flow. One would be a large-scale invasion or migration. The other kind would be population A intermarries with population B, population B intermarries with population C, population C intermarries with population D. And of course, this way genes from here can move a long distance over long periods of time, depending upon the amount of interbreeding that goes on. We know it happens, and it happens everywhere. It happened even in the Pleistocene. Neanderthals had trade routes and where goods flow, obviously genes flow as well. Those traveling salesman jokes were probably there back in the Pleistocene as well.</p>\n\n<p>We used to think that human history consisted of population branching and was always divergent. These people moved here and stayed here, and then those people moved over there and stayed over there, and this group moved over there and stayed over there. That's incredibly simplistic because what we know is that human evolution is not constantly divergent, human evolution is reticulated - that is to say, it's like the capillaries in a blood stream. They branch apart, they come back together. These people go over here and they encounter and interbreed with others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is non-concordance and what does it tell us about race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>By non-concordance, what we mean is that different individual traits in the human species don't share the same patterns of variation across geographic space.. Skin color for example, varies with latitude. Certain people have brown hair and blue eyes. Other people have blond hair and blue eyes. And even though there's a statistical association of those particular features, they're not invariably expressed with one another. Certainly dark skin is present all over the world in different populations. Indigenous Australians, indigenous peoples of India, indigenous peoples of Africa are all very darkly pigmented even though they're not particularly closely related. And one of the interesting problems with the theory of race is that if you look at the peoples of, for example, the Indian sub-continent, you find people who are darkly pigmented like Africans, have hair like East Asians, and facially resemble Europeans. They live on the continent of Asia. What do you do with these people?</p>\n\n<p>Traits are non-concordant because genes are inherited independently of one another to a large extent. We can look at patterns of body parts and patterns of body form, but it's very hard to associate specific genetic patterns with specific body patterns. Interestingly though, we generally find the same geographical patterns whether we look at bodies or whether we look at genes. And that pattern is that most variation is within the group. We don't find large clusters of relatively homogeneous people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are clines?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In anthropology we talk about clinal variation. Cline is a term that was devised by the biologist Julian Huxley to represent a geographical gradient in a particular trait across a species. So if you've got a broadly distributed species that has a particular form, whether it's body shape or color - let's say in the north it looks different from the south but they're the same species - you can't really draw a line and say there's two kinds of frogs that have this or that particular form. Instead, the variation is gradual and continuous. What Huxley argued is that we should talk not about discrete racial variation, but about gradual clinal variation. And about 30 years after Huxley proposed the term clines, anthropologists came to recognize that pretty much all variation in the human species is clinal - that is to say, continuous and gradual across geography, and not discrete, not racial.</p>\n\n<p>When anthropologist Frank Livingston wrote in the early 1960s \"There are no races, there are only clines,\" what he was doing was summarizing epigrammatically what anthropologists had come to realize since about World War II, with the work of Ashley Montagu: that the human species simply doesn't come patterned the way we thought it came patterned, and that the way we were thinking about natural patterns of human variation was really topsy-turvy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is wrong with the claim that some 'races' are naturally better athletes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A person's accomplishments are obviously a consequence, to some extent, of the abilities that they have. If you didn't have the ability to do something, you couldn't do it. But the fact that you didn't do it, the fact that you didn't accomplish something, doesn't necessarily mean you didn't have the ability to do it. It simply means that for whatever reason, it didn't happen. So there's a basic asymmetry here between, on the one hand, the observation of a performance, and the inference of an ability from the observation of that performance. If the performance exists, you know the ability existed. But if the performance doesn't exist, you can't tell if the ability didn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there's this wonderful fallacy out there that I can compare what groups of people accomplish and somehow infer what groups of people are capable of, or what they're not capable of. And so there's this argument, for example, that because blacks are so overrepresented in the NBA, and so underrepresented in the AMA it means that they're really talented at basketball and not so talented at medicine. That this disparity is somehow a reflection of their underlying natural abilities is simply a fallacy because we can't draw a conclusion about underlying abilities from observations of performance.</p>\n\n<p>If we could infer the existence of innate basketball talent, innate basketball ability, from the observation of the overrepresentation of blacks in the NBA, we then have to infer the existence of comedy genes in Jews by virtue of the overrepresentation of Jews in comedy. Or the overrepresentation of Irish in the police force. Obviously there are all kinds of factors that go into occupational specializations and they're not necessarily reflections of underlying abilities. If we don't have a scientific way to study underlying abilities, we shouldn't be talking about it as if it's scientific discourse, because it's not. It might be fun to talk about at a bar, but it's not scientific discourse.</p>\n\n<p>As scientists, we can only study what we can measure. And we can only measure performances. That's all we have access to. We can't measure abilities.</p>\n\n<p>Every performance occurs within a context of a lived life, and the conditions of growth and development and nutrition. Now, a successful performance obviously involves things like training and coaching, psyching out, teamwork, nutrition, the conditions of growth, your own self-image, what you think you're good at. And unless we can control these kinds of variables, we simply can't look at, say, the success of East African marathoners as evidence for East African native ability in running. It's not to say that East Africans don't have native abilities. But the onus is on people who declare that there is some sort of natural ability to be able to tell us exactly where they see natural ability, and how they know it's not caused by other things. If you have many causes and one effect, it's unscientific to simply say, \"I isolate one of these causes without doing appropriate controls.\" That's why we do controls in science.</p>\n\n<p>If you go back to the record books, you find many prominent Jewish basketball players in the 1940s. You go to the 1910s, 1920s, in both America and in London there were many prominent Jewish boxers. Where are the great Jewish boxers today? I mean it, it almost sounds like a contradiction in terms, \"great Jewish boxer.\" Where are the Jewish boxers today? Well, they're in medical school. That wasn't an option in the 1920s.</p>\n\n<p>As doors open that enable different populations to rise socioeconomically, and go into the middle class, boxing is a less attractive option. If you're a parent, having your son beat up for a living just isn't that attractive a job to encourage your child to go into if you perceive that there are other options open to him. If you perceive that there aren't other options open to him, it's certainly as good as anything else. And that's why of course, something like boxing is very much class dominated. Which is not to say that there are no boxers from other socioeconomic groups. But it's a sport that has traditionally been drawn from the lower socioeconomic classes. Why? They don't perceive they have other options in life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between Social Darwinism and eugenics?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After Darwin wrote The Origin of Species and pretty much convinced the scientific community that competition was the cause of diversity in the animal and plant world, the question was, \"Well, was this similar to what went on in the social world?\"</p>\n\n<p>And a very heterogeneous movement called Social Darwinism - which appropriated the label of Darwin because it had scientific cache - arose, which sought to justify economic and social inequalities by recourse to natural patterns of variation. That is to say, the people at the top deserve to be at the top, because their natural abilities are being brought out, and the people at the bottom deserve to be at the bottom, because they suck.</p>\n\n<p>The political implications of this were that if we were to develop child labor laws, welfare to aid the poor, etc. that would be a subversion of the natural order, because the natural order is the cause of the social hierarchy. The people at the top deserve to be at the top, the people at the bottom deserve to be at the bottom, and if we help the people at the bottom rise, well, they shouldn't be rising, because they're where they deserve to be. And what the Social Darwinists argued was for government to get off the backs of the people. They didn't want a government intervention in the rapacious capitalism of the late 19th century. They were rightly very quickly perceived as simply apologists for the greedy rich, and the movement pretty much fizzled out by the turn of the 20th century. But it was replaced by the idea of eugenics.</p>\n\n<p>And what eugenics did to the Social Darwinist movement was to preserve one idea - namely that the social hierarchy is a reflection of differences in natural endowment. But it reversed one point very importantly. And that is instead of the Social Darwinists wanting government off the backs of the people what the eugenicists wanted was direct government intervention. They wanted federal laws to restrict immigration and to sterilize the poor against their will.</p>\n\n<p>The ideas of eugenicists were very conducive to totalitarian governments in the 1920s and 1930s. They wanted strong centralized authority to impose their scientific will on the population. There was a very strong degree of utopian dreaming that if everybody just gave geneticists a lot of authority and a lot of money and stood out of the way, we would build a great society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How many \"races\" did traditional anthropologists come up with?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anthropologists who originally looked at Europeans as a race, or a subspecies, and Africans, and Native Americans, and Asians, were quickly faced with the fact that Europeans don't all look alike. If you go from northern Europe to southern Europe, we now know of course, what we see as a gradient, what we see is a cline, or many different clines of features. But, if your mindset is that to analyze it scientifically, you must impose discrete barriers and classify it, you're faced with how do you break up the continuous variation in Europe into discrete groups?</p>\n\n<p>And so they began to find races within races. So within the European race they found the Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean races: three discrete kinds of people that don't really exist within a larger group, \"Caucasians\" that doesn't really exist, in contrast to another group. So the word \"race\" took on this very nebulous characteristic. There were races within races within sub-races. In a book called The Races of Europe, Carlton Coon found over 20 races in Europe alone.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this was the imposition of a fundamentally wrong-headed approach on the question of analyzing human variation. What they were trying to do was box it, to classify it, when what they needed to do was to analyze it, and study it in terms of asking what kinds of patterns are there, instead of assuming and imposing the patterns on the variation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do we make of the claims of geneticists that our \"natures\" are determined by our genes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the problems in interpreting the statements of geneticists even today is that 95% of everything a geneticist says is code for \"Give me more money.\" Therefore, when a geneticist says that everything important in life is genetic, you have to realize that they have a conflict of interest. Why? They're geneticists. Of course they want you to believe that everything important in life is genetic, in the same way an Oldsmobile salesman tells you that an Oldsmobile is the best car on the road. That might be true, but of course they have a vested interest in your believing it.</p>\n\n<p>Behavioral genetics is a wonderful endeavor. It's a really interesting field to be in - studying the genetic differences that lead to behavioral differences. But it's focused on a really, really small part of the pie. When we look at the differences in behavior that exist in the human species, we know how that's patterned. It's patterned in a very particular way. Most behavioral variation in the human species is localized between groups - that is to say, most behavioral variation in the human species is: the French eat with forks, the Chinese eat with chopsticks. The French use nasalized vowels, the Spanish don't. This group of people eats this kind of food, and considers that other kind of food repellent. This group of people classifies kin in this way, they classify their kin in a different way. These group of people wear saris, this group of people wear pants.</p>\n\n<p>This is cultural variation. It accounts for the great majority of behavioral variation in the human species and we know something about it. We know it's caused by the circumstances of history. How do we know this? Immigrant studies. We know that people immigrate, and they adopt the ways of other people in a generation, maybe a couple of generations. But we know that very quickly one group of people can do what another group of people does and it doesn't have to do with their genes.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, within any population, there are behavioral differences. There are people with different personality traits; some more introverted, some more extroverted; some better at math, some more verbally agile. These are due to a lot of different causes, some of which may be historical. Some of which may result from the circumstances of upbringing. Some may be due to nutrition. Some may be due to differences in genetics.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing here though, is that the extent to which genetics influences behavior in humans has got to be a very, very small part of the spectrum of the range of human behavior, because the vast majority of difference in human behavior is not genetic in origin; it's cultural in origin.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that anthropology showed me is that even observing a consistent physical difference between populations is not adequate evidence for that difference being genetic. The fact that it's always there doesn't mean that it's innate. And a nice example of this was revealed by the anthropologist Franz Boas in the early part of this century, who studied variation in skull form in immigrants.</p>\n\n<p>In the late 19th century, it was shown that different groups of people had, on the average, different shaped skulls; some longer, some broader. And these differences in skull shape were found to be very consistent and very uniform. Different populations tended to have similarly shaped skulls. Boas wanted to question whether or not skull shape was sensitive to the conditions of life.</p>\n\n<p>And what Boas determined by studying immigrants to Ellis Island, from two different populations that were known for having different shaped skulls, is that after they were living in the United States for a considerable number of years, their skull shapes changed. In other words, the fact of immigration and growing up in a different place changed the shape of your skull.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a radical proposition. We know that the body is sensitive to the conditions of life, and to the conditions of development. Boas simply showed, in a very graphical and in a very statistical sense, that a particular body form that was thought to be innate, that was thought to reflect a constitutional genetic character - the shape of your skull - was, in fact, much more sensitive to the conditions of life, much more plastic than had previously been thought.</p>\n\n<p>In the history of anthropology, what we find is that more and more traits that are thought to be innate - traits that are thought to be natural differences, because they've always been there - are more and more shown to be ephemeral, the results of social history.</p>\n\n<p>What we need to recognize is that standards of evidence are crucial here. And standards of evidence now have to dictate that to infer a genetic basis for difference requires genetic data. Simply observing phenotypic differences, simply observing differences that are measurable in body form, or in performance are an inadequate basis on which to infer a difference in the genes, because patterns of genetic variation don't map very easily onto patterns of physical variation.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"605cc37e-9f28-438a-b7e0-c5b7976597a3","name":"Science: Genetics","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}},{"id":"be792eba-e162-4441-abb6-f7c943962a6d","name":"Science: Pseudoscience","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Phenotype","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Scientific and Folk Ideas About Heredity","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>We make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/c51cd4ffaef17f2448fdce30f36ec797-bb1c2ef684bb0489a2511453032a3e2d.png"}}}},{"title":"Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Our eyes tell us that people look different.

If other venues are open to you, that don't involve getting beaten up on a regular basis, you're probably more likely to take those.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at the general issue of occupational overrepresentation, as evidence of genetic superiority, we're kind of left with the promise of Irish policeman yielding Irish police genes, and Jewish comedians being the result of Jewish comedy genes, and Chinese laundry genes, which, of course, is ridiculous. The point of all this is that there are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to certain professions and certain occupations and certain things to do with their lives. Only one of which is that they have some sort of natural ability for it.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point is that while we like to talk about ability, we have no real way of measuring it. It's a metaphysical, abstract quality. Ability is something you're born with that is independent of the development you will incur during your life. But the fact is, the only thing that we can measure is what you actually do, how you actually perform. The score you get on a pencil and paper test, or whether you actually shoot ten free throws in a row. And that is not independent of the life history that you have. Any IQ test, for example, has a vocabulary component. And there's no way that you can talk about vocabulary that is independent of the words you've been exposed to during the course of your life!</p>"},"changed":1531504567}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":[{"title":"The idea of race as biology is persistent on America's playing fields, but it is an idea that is not true.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://vimeo.com/newsreeldigital/review/268928749/efc229755c","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/f26cce97d96996109da7f5bed5fcc748-ed3056bc1144bb386595c230497645fe.png"}}}}]}},{"name":"Non-Concordance","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Why Humans haven't Evolved into Subspecies","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/1e294a9de8ff0733cf4c5e21bff265eb-cd24700e7e40476025f4c1c63f8f5bf1.jpg"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Eugenics","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race and Gene Studies: What Differences Make a Difference?","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Race does matter.

There's also an overrepresentation of Hispanics in boxing. It's a consequence of the opportunities open to the particular group in question. And where most avenues to upward mobility are closed to you, you're going to gravitate to something that seems just as low a probability of success as anything else. If other venues are open to you, that don't involve getting beaten up on a regular basis, you're probably more likely to take those.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at the general issue of occupational overrepresentation, as evidence of genetic superiority, we're kind of left with the promise of Irish policeman yielding Irish police genes, and Jewish comedians being the result of Jewish comedy genes, and Chinese laundry genes, which, of course, is ridiculous. The point of all this is that there are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to certain professions and certain occupations and certain things to do with their lives. Only one of which is that they have some sort of natural ability for it.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point is that while we like to talk about ability, we have no real way of measuring it. It's a metaphysical, abstract quality. Ability is something you're born with that is independent of the development you will incur during your life. But the fact is, the only thing that we can measure is what you actually do, how you actually perform. The score you get on a pencil and paper test, or whether you actually shoot ten free throws in a row. And that is not independent of the life history that you have. Any IQ test, for example, has a vocabulary component. And there's no way that you can talk about vocabulary that is independent of the words you've been exposed to during the course of your life!</p>"},"changed":1531504567},{"title":"How do you explain 98% genetic similarity but huge phenotypic variation?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>The question is what does the number mean?

So the greater the amount of variation within, the greater the number of variables that you're going to need to define a race.

The more similar two species are, the more closely related they are by common descent. It's a bit more complicated with human populations because there's two ways that human populations can be similar to one another. Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow. Unfortunately, it's very hard to distinguish one pattern from the other. Are two populations similar by virtue of sharing common ancestry or genetic unions? The extraction of historical details from genetic patterns is actually a lot more difficult than it's generally represented in the media.

It's having ancestors who were in a geographic region where those things either occurred by chance or were selected for, as in the sickle cell case. Although many people in the U.S. think sickle cell is a disease of black people, that's not necessarily true. Sickle cell is found in people in Greece, the island of Orchomenos, in particular, has very high carrier rates for sickle cell. There are also high carrier rates among people on the Arabian peninsula and people in India. There are parts of India where sickle cell carrier rate is as high as it is anywhere in Africa. On the other hand, people in the southern part of Africa - or people whose ancestry goes back to the southern part of Africa - don't have high sickle cell carrier rates because that allele is selected for only in human beings who have lived where there's a high incidence of malaria, which you don't find in southern Africa.

I can very clearly say that this assumption is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, there were a number of forensic studies in which they tried to separate individuals into different so-called races depending on what they were looking at in the bones - size and shapes of skulls mostly. And they thought they had it. But when any of these studies has been replicated, looking at individuals from a different area or a different time, the results, sadly, are little better than random assignment.</p>\n\n<p>I think the reason why this is true is very interesting. It really smacks at how fluid social definitions of race are and even how fluid, sometimes, biologies are. Biology can change, or at least phenotypes can change, from generation to generation. So if you did an initial study on say, bones of so-called blacks and whites in Cleveland, and then do a study of so-called blacks, whites, and Native Americans in Arizona, you actually find that the blacks in Arizona look different from the blacks in Cleveland. And the whites, in fact, look so different that one could even assign them into a different \"race.\" In the same way, maybe, we could say Japanese immigrants look different once they come to the United States versus when they were in Japan.</p>\n\n<p>The DNA question is a little bit different. I think the answer to that one is that we're not identifying race, we are identifying individuals. Individual DNA is what's unique. Let's face it, it's not important to find a race, it's important to find an individual. That question also very much applies to medicine. Why would forensics investigators even want to determine a person's race? Because you're not trying to find a black or white or Asian. You're trying, most often, to find a person, so you're looking for unique markers, not ones that are generalizable to a group. Secondly, it kind of is a game in which you have to make, first, the assumption that there is such a thing as race. And then if you do put individuals into four or five essential types, the more data you look at - just by matter of pure statistics - the higher your probabilities are going to be of sorting into those groups.

Interestingly, if it fails, we're probably less likely to hear about it because it's a technological failure. But now it's in the New York Times because, at least at this point, it seems interesting and it seems to be successful.</p>\n\n<p>But the question is - let's take this another way - will somebody in Germany now pick up this methodology and assume, okay, I can use the same bunch of alleles in Germany to distinguish Africans who have come to Germany directly from Africa - say Algeria, for example - and I'm going to compare that to Germans.

To me, \"blind\" means not being able to see things, and wanting to be \"blind\" to color or race seems to mean wanting to ignore race or pretend its social and historical effects don't exist. When the larger question is how do we have an equitable society today, we have to be mindful of the historical and social complexities of race, not willfully ignore them. [Unless, of course, one believes that race doesn't have or hasn't had any impact, in which case there's no need for discussion.] We should strive to be color \"full\" rather than colorblind.<br /><br />\nThis doesn't mean, however, that we should divide people by race today. A central difficulty is the slipperiness of race and the many forms it's taken historically. To address the issue of race and equality, we must consider color in several different, seemingly contrary ways. The first is to recognize race's illusory status to avoid recapitulating racial categories and racial divides. The second is to acknowledge the real effect those categories have had and continue to have on peoples' lives and circumstances. And the third is to understand that racial divides, by their very nature, create imbalance and inequality.<br /><br />\nThese various shades of \"color\" must all be kept in perspective, none at the expense of the other, if we want to address seriously the question of how to be an equitable society today. There may not be a solution, but if there is one, it will almost certainly be difficult, and it will require effort, awareness, and responsibility.

The problem is there's a whole spectrum of genetic variation, but we impose simplistic racial categories on this spectrum.

Sometimes when we see statistically significant differences, we attribute it to race. But in any study, you're looking at a subpopulation within that race. A subpopulation might have something genetically interesting about it at a particular locus, but that doesn't necessarily tell you anything about the race writ large. It may mean that this particular subpopulation experienced some interesting historical event which shaped it in a certain way. An example of this is Tay-Sachs, which is a genetically inherited disease. People of northern European Jewish ancestry may be at higher risk because of something that happened to an ancestral population. So if you're descended from this ancestral population, you'll have that higher risk. If you include those people in the overall \"white\" population, it might look like there's a slightly elevated risk for white people to pass on Tay-Sachs, but it only appears that way because of an elevated risk within this one little subpopulation.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think it's so embedded in genetic research - that it inevitably happens.

There are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to sports as a vocation. For example, in boxing, there's an overrepresentation of blacks. There's also an overrepresentation of Hispanics in boxing. It's a consequence of the opportunities open to the particular group in question. And where most avenues to upward mobility are closed to you, you're going to gravitate to something that seems just as low a probability of success as anything else. If other venues are open to you, that don't involve getting beaten up on a regular basis, you're probably more likely to take those.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at the general issue of occupational overrepresentation, as evidence of genetic superiority, we're kind of left with the promise of Irish policeman yielding Irish police genes, and Jewish comedians being the result of Jewish comedy genes, and Chinese laundry genes, which, of course, is ridiculous. The point of all this is that there are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to certain professions and certain occupations and certain things to do with their lives. Only one of which is that they have some sort of natural ability for it.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point is that while we like to talk about ability, we have no real way of measuring it. It's a metaphysical, abstract quality. Ability is something you're born with that is independent of the development you will incur during your life. But the fact is, the only thing that we can measure is what you actually do, how you actually perform. The score you get on a pencil and paper test, or whether you actually shoot ten free throws in a row. And that is not independent of the life history that you have. Any IQ test, for example, has a vocabulary component. And there's no way that you can talk about vocabulary that is independent of the words you've been exposed to during the course of your life!</p>"},"changed":1531504567},{"title":"How do you explain 98% genetic similarity but huge phenotypic variation?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>The question is what does the number mean?
