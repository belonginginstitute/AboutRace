Recognizing important distinctions among the categories \"natural,\" \"biological\" and \"genetic\" is a key to making sense of this controversy.</p>\n\n<p>Human races are not genetically definable categories. There are no subdivisions found \"in nature\" that separate one race or group of humans from another. Race might be better defined as a social hierarchy - a set of social relationships through which some groups of people are subordinated while others are elevated in power and status.</p>\n\n<p>Although races are created socially they are, nonetheless, real, in the same sense that marriage or the school year are real. Furthermore, as we relate to each other in terms of race, we create material conditions in the world. Race is a powerful predictor of where a person lives, where and to what degree she is educated, how much money she makes, whether she has health insurance, how she is treated by physicians, and the degree to which she is exposed to toxic substances in her work or home environment. These material manifestations of race can have direct and indirect health consequences, thereby establishing a relationship between the social realities of race and our human biology.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, human organisms respond biologically to social experience. We do find racial disparities in rates of diabetes or responses to medications, and these are important to study. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is that when we observe racial differences in health status we should not infer that these are caused by genetic differences between/among races. Our current knowledge suggests that genetics is the least likely cause of most racial disparities in health.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks    "},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null,"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"be792eba-e162-4441-abb6-f7c943962a6d","name":"Science: Pseudoscience","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"Health","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Is it true that people metabolize drugs at different rates and that this correlates with \"racial\" groupings?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>People do metabolize drugs at different rates, and this is due to many factors, only some of which are genetic.
