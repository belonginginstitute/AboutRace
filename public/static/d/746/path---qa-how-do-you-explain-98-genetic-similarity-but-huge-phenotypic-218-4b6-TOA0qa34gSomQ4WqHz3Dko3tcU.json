Sure, there's one and a half percent genetic difference between a human and a chimpanzee. And that gives us a lot of leeway to have developed walking and talking and sensuality and civilization, and all the other wonderful trappings of being human - out of our genetic background. Obviously, all humans are far more similar to one another than any of them is to a chimpanzee. And obviously there is very little genetic difference at the root of all of the physical differences that we find among the peoples of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I think the important question is, what is the pattern that we find when we look at biological diversity in the human species? What we find is that all this physical and genetic diversity is not separating Africans from Asians from Europeans from Native Americans. It's separating us out in much more complicated ways. In fact, the great majority of the variation being found is within populations.</p>\n\n<p>A little bit more separates out local populations from one another, and very little of the genetic diversity actually separates continental groups. A little bit of genetic variation can go a long way. One single nucleotide change can give you sickle cell anemia, one single nucleotide change can make you an achondroplastic dwarf. That's simply the nature of variation. But I don't know what that has to do with race.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"b611a797-fd6c-4af7-a8ff-96599e45a0b8"}}
