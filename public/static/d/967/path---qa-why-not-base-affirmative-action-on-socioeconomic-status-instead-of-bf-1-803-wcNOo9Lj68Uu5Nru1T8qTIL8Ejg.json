People who have been at the forefront of crafting affirmative action policies have in fact often pursued race and class policies. For example, the affirmative action program at UC Davis medical school which was stricken by the Supreme Court in the historic 1978 Bakke case was a race and class program. Through a series of conservative legal decisions and political maneuvering, these race/class forms of affirmative action were defeated. And let's not kid ourselves - the elite in this country have never been about equalizing opportunities based on class. In the 1973 Rodriguez case out of Texas, for example, the Supreme Court found that wildly disparate school financing districts did not contradict the principle of equal protection. As a legal system and as a society, we have not really been about class equalization and it is disingenuous to try to create a zero-sum game between class politics and affirmative action. The truth is that class-based programs will result in an overall net gain for whites and a net loss for the groups of color currently benefiting from affirmative action. Any class-based policies we advocate must, therefore, not displace existing race-based ones.

This gets back to this issue that is so central to the film series: the long history of the political and economic discrimination against certain racial groups.

The idea of a permanent affirmative action policy is used to scare people who might otherwise support affirmative action. Affirmative action opponents play upon fears that proactive measures will become a politically inscribed remedy that society will never be rid of once they are put into place. Past practice has proven that that's just not the case. At the outset of affirmative action programs, women were incredibly underrepresented in fields such as law and medicine and that gap was quickly eliminated within just a couple of years. Since then, in most programs, women (as an aggregate category) no longer benefit from affirmative action. The same thing happened with various subcategories of Asians at schools in the 1970s.

The idea of a permanent affirmative action policy is used to scare people who might otherwise support affirmative action. Affirmative action opponents play upon fears that proactive measures will become a politically inscribed remedy that society will never be rid of once they are put into place. Past practice has proven that that's just not the case. At the outset of affirmative action programs, women were incredibly underrepresented in fields such as law and medicine and that gap was quickly eliminated within just a couple of years. Since then, in most programs, women (as an aggregate category) no longer benefit from affirmative action. The same thing happened with various subcategories of Asians at schools in the 1970s. For example, Japanese Americans were removed from affirmative action consideration at the UC Berkeley law school. Historically, admissions committees have used representational numbers as a guideline for which groups continue to need affirmative action and which ones do not.</p>\n\n<p>But note that legislation such as the new Ward Connerly initiative (the racial privacy initiative that's actually being renamed the \"Information Ban Initiative\") seeks to ban the collection of race-based data as an outdated invasion of privacy. Should such an ill-advised measure succeed, it would be impossible to measure progress (or setbacks). If we are supposed to be an egalitarian society, don't we want to know where the racial disparities are? Don't we care that Dorothy Roberts, in her recent book Shattered Bonds, discovered that 95% of all the children in the foster care system in Chicago are black? Or that 42% of the children in the foster care system nationwide are black even though they constitute only 17% of the nation's children? If we do care, then we need to keep records as a measure for devising social policies to address these troubling disparities.</p>"},"changed":1531439124},{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.

It also might ensure that these policies get to the people who need it the most; i.e., poor minorities.
