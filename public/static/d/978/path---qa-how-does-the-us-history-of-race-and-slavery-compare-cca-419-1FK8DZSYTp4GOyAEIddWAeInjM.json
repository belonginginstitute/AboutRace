For example, the Irish were seen by the English as a separate race. I think many of us know that, especially during the Second World War period and before, Jewish people were often referred to as part of the Jewish race. In this way, the term race, by today's standards, was used very loosely to define the other, which is different from how we think of it today.</p>\n\n<p>As Audrey mentioned, in societies before, people could be enslaved for all sorts of reasons. Originally, a slave was a person taken in combat. Rather than being killed, they were taken as a prisoner of war, and used as a forced laborer. Now, there's a very important distinction between the idea of a person as a forced laborer and the idea of a slave in the American context. If you are taken in a war and you become a forced laborer or slave, that means you are a slave because of circumstances. And the person for whom you work is in his situation because of circumstances. And we all know that had circumstances been different, the roles might have been reversed.</p>\n\n<p>In American society, the notion emerged that a person was a slave because of God's will. Because of something peculiar to that person that made it acceptable for that person to be held in this position of forced labor, and for this condition to be passed along generation after generation after generation. Because it wasn't just circumstances. And it wasn't even something peculiar to this person. It was something peculiar to the larger group from which this person comes - a special category of human bondage. Now that, then, is what's distinctive, and it's what is so difficult for us to deal with today. This notion that people were slaves because of something peculiar to the larger group from which this person comes. Slavery is gone, but the characteristics attributed to this larger group still remain. That's what racism is all about.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null,"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"8bd2ab46-3dab-4d28-8d25-67ebff32d455","name":"Racial Classifiation: Changing Categories","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"'Mixed' race","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"How does the US history of race and slavery compare to slavery in the rest of world history?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>I think of course, it depends on how you define race.
