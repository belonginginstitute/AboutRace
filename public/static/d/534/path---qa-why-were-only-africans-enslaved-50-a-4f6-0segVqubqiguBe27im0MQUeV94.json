Africans were not English and were not part of this system, and I think it became easier to enslave Africans for life.

But then you get to the point, well, what about the converted slaves, shouldn't they then be freed? It was at that point, I think, that race really kicks in. You begin to say it's not a matter of their being heathens, and you get the first legislation prohibiting the manumission of converted slaves, or not prohibiting it, but not making it mandatory.
