You wouldn't find any political support for it, but essentially that's the mechanism that created the middle class and also created racial inequity through homeownership and real estate. The different mechanisms people are talking about are basically ways of changing how people actually decide the value of their homes. In other words, introducing some sort of financial incentive for people not to make certain choices. This is a great example of how people's individual choices perpetuate racism in a way that they don't obviously think about. So it's a great way to illustrate how our choices actually can change these systems. Choosing not to sell your home immediately - even if the financial value might go down - when blacks or anybody else moves into your neighborhood is a great example because the \"value\" of your home isn't just financial.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"David Freund"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>In terms of resources on this, I would like to refer people to two sources on metropolitics. john a. powell's work on race, poverty, and urban sprawl and why urban sprawl is a civil rights issue, and Myron Orfield's book, American Metropolitics.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"0b5d9d88-1f6f-478c-b931-83f28ab8e394","name":"Structured Advantage: Civil Rights","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"66d1f34e-1b54-4f88-a147-9a0e19aeac3a","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Housing and Ownership","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}},{"id":"b6696374-c1d9-45c7-b69a-41da2314f0a9","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Intergenerational Wealth and Poverty","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"Suburbs/Suburbanization","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Segregated Housing and the Racial Wealth Gap","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/d6496c4a4fa69484ccfc4c847216fa83-e219e7eeef7ed6a01062b712d491d368.png"}}}},{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"What policies might integrate the suburbs and remedy some of the inequities that stem from residential segregation?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>The racial situation in America is in the interest of those who are racially privileged (i.e., whites) and nowhere does the rubber hit the road more than in real estate.

The idea of a permanent affirmative action policy is used to scare people who might otherwise support affirmative action. Affirmative action opponents play upon fears that proactive measures will become a politically inscribed remedy that society will never be rid of once they are put into place. Past practice has proven that that's just not the case. At the outset of affirmative action programs, women were incredibly underrepresented in fields such as law and medicine and that gap was quickly eliminated within just a couple of years.
