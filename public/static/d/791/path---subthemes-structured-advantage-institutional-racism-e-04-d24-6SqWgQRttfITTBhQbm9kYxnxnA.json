On the other hand, people in the southern part of Africa - or people whose ancestry goes back to the southern part of Africa - don't have high sickle cell carrier rates because that allele is selected for only in human beings who have lived where there's a high incidence of malaria, which you don't find in southern Africa. People do not carry the sickle cell gene variant because they are of a certain race, but because of some more particularized population history.</p>\n\n<p>I also think it's worth pointing out that, while we make claims about the sickle cell carrier rate in black people and white people in the U.S., if you were to go to a period of our history where we defined black and white differently, then those numbers would be different. Or if we were to go to the Bahamas or maybe to Brazil, where currently the perceptions of black and white are different than they are here in the U.S., then the carrier rate numbers would be different. There would probably be a higher carrier rate for sickle cell gene variants in the white population in the Bahamas or Brazil, than there is here. That's because in the U.S. we draw the line so that anybody who looks like they have the slightest bit of African ancestry gets put in the black category. But that's not true everywhere, and it's not even necessarily true at all times in the United States. We can come up with numbers signifying the rate at which a group of people carries a particular gene variant, and those numbers may be accurate and scientifically valid, but we still need to recognize the ways in which the number is arbitrary. These carrier rate numbers will not be true for all times and all places, in part because the way in which we divide up the spectrum of human genetic variation changes; we don't always divide it the same way.</p>"},"changed":1531506382},{"title":"Does the series suggest there are no genetic differences between populations?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>No, not in the least.

So too do all the other 19th and early 20th century exertions to distinguish races by facial angle, skull size, cranial index, length of shin bone and blood type. Our growing knowledge of the genome and human evolutionary history help us understand why all such efforts to locate the source of innate racial difference were doomed: it doesn't exist. Most geneticists and anthropologists who study human variation agree that humans just don't come bundled into three or four separate groups according to skin color and other physical traits.Â </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, \"discoveries\" of racial difference resurface in the press with predictable regularity. Often they spotlight differential rates of diseases, or responses to a drug. Sometimes they zero in on a genetics study.</p>\n\n<p>That was the case recently with a report published in Science magazine (Dec. 20, 2002). Noah Rosenberg, Marcus Feldman and others analyzed the variation in 377 different DNA sequences from 1056 individuals from around the world. They found that 95% of the DNA variation they studied is due to differences between individuals within any continent. But they also found they could use the remaining 5% of the variation as genetic \"footprints\" indicating the continent from which an individual's recent ancestors came.Â </p>\n\n<p>Some were quick to interpret these results as evidence that old-fashioned notions of the \"races of man\" have been correct all along. But does it? What do these studies actually tell us? And why should our interpretations matter?</p>\n\n<p>Reports about such studies commonly fall prey to three confusions: they conflate DNA markers of ancestry with markers of race. They mistake the fact that some gene variants are more common in some populations than others as signs of racial \"difference\" between those populations. And they assume that disparities in group outcomes can be attributed to inborn, or genetic, differences between races.Â </p>\n\n<p>The idea of biological race assumes traits come packaged together, even color-coded for our convenience, as anthropologist Jonathan Marks jokes. In otherwords, if biological race were real, we'd find that skin color or other \"racial\" markers would correlate with a suite of other genetic traits. Knowing an individual's \"race\" should enable us to predict his or her other genes and traits.</p>\n\n<p>But the DNA sequences studied by Rosenberg and his colleagues are not genes. Known by geneticists as \"microsatellite short tandem repeats\" (and more colloquially as \"junk DNA\"), they do not code for proteins, but just sit there taking up space in our DNA. Mutations in DNA sequences that don't code for anything are not affected by natural and sexual selection. They are neither selected for nor against but are simply passed down, generation to generation. Comparing these accumulated mutation patterns can provide clues to ancient population movements. But they have no effect on physical traits such as skin color or hair form or blood type.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the study accomplished the same thing our eyes do everyday. You can look at someone and stand a pretty good chance of identifying the continent where that person's recent ancestors lived, especially if you're gazing at someone whose family has resided in the same place for several generations - as did all the subjects of the study.Â </p>\n\n<p>But what's that got to do with \"race\"? We all have ancestors from elsewhere - and if we go back far enough, about 70,000 or so years ago, all our ancestors can be traced back to Africa. But if our idea of race assumes that different groups each share among themselves a different suite of inborn traits, then we have to ask, \"What difference makes a difference?\" Certainly not micro-satellite short tandem repeats.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there's no question that some gene forms show up more often in some populations than others: alleles that code for blue eyes, or the A, B, O blood groups, and of course, those alleles that influence skin color. (We all have the same 30,000 or so genes. But some genes come in different forms, or varieties, called alleles.) But just because some members of a population might carry a specific gene form, doesn't mean all members do. Only a small percentage of Ashkenazi Jews carry the Tay-Sachs allele. When a couple I know were screened upon their pregnancy, the non-Jewish partner was found to be the Tay-Sachs carrier, not the Jewish one.</p>\n\n<p>That's because most human variation falls within, not between populations. About 85% of all genetic variation can, on average, be found within any local population, be they Swedes, Kikuyu, or Hmong. About 94% can be found within any continental population, consistent with what the Rosenberg Science study found. In fact, there are no characteristics, no traits, not even one gene that turns up in all members of one so-called race yet is absent from others.Â </p>\n\n<p>Take sickle cell. Doctors were long taught that sickle cell anemia was a genetic disease of Negroes, a marker of their race. Yet sickle cell is found among peoples from central and western Africa, but not southern Africa. It is also carried by Turks, Yemenis, Indians, Greeks, and Sicilians. That's because sickle cell arose several thousand years ago as a mutation in one of the genes that codes for hemoglobin. The mutation soon spread to successive populations along the trade routes where malaria was common. It turns out that inheriting one sickle cell allele confers resistance to malaria and thus provides a selective advantage in malarial regions (inheriting sickle cell alleles from both parents causes sickle-cell disease). In other words, sickle cell, like tandem repeats in the Science study, is a marker not of skin color or race but ancestry, or more precisely, having ancestors from where malaria was common.Â </p>\n\n<p>Like sickle cell, most traits are influenced by separate genes and inherited independently one from another. They are said to be \"non-concordant.\" Someone with brown hair might carry A, B or O blood. Sub-Saharan Africans tend to have dark skin. But so too do Dravidians from India, Aborigines from Australia, and Melanesians from the South Pacific. Large numbers of West Africans are lactose intolerant as are Japanese, but East Africans aren't. German and Papua New Guinean populations have almost exactly the same frequencies of A, B and O blood. At one point on the genome an individual might share a gene form common in Africa, at another site East Asia, and still another, Europe. Jared Diamond and others have pointed out that for each trait we can classify people into \"races\" by that trait, each giving us different and overlapping races depending on the trait selected.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Rosenberg team found they could cluster the individuals in their sample into several different statistically significant groups, only one of which corresponded to five continents. They also found that no matter which clustering scheme they used, individuals could be placed in more than one group.Â </p>\n\n<p>The reason for all this within-group variation is because unlike most other species, modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, are young, only about 150,000 years or so old, and we've always moved. As humans migrated around the globe, populations bumped into each other and shared their mates - and genes. Sometimes genes flowed across great distances - through trade, war, slavery, piracy, exile and migration. More often they flowed from village to village to village. Human populations just haven't been isolated from each other long enough to evolve into separate sub-species, or races.</p>\n\n<p>Ancestry is important in genetics and health care. I would like to know if I were descended from a population at risk for sickle cell, or the blood disease porphyria, or Tay Sachs. Oliver Sachs has even written famously of an island of the colorblind. But because of non-concordance, the geographic shape of populations at genetic risk for a specific disease or adverse drug response change amoeba-like depending upon the trait under study. These populations do not map onto what we think of as race. To assume they do is medically troublesome on several accounts.Â </p>\n\n<p>First, doctors might be tempted to use race as a very unreliable surrogate for an individual's own unique ancestry and patterns of inheritance. And insofar as 94% of all genetic variants can be found within any continent, assigning someone to a \"racial\" continent of origin is too gross a scale to narrow down the range of possibilities very much. (Some variants do correlate on a finer scale with ethnic groups, and on a scale smaller yet with recent family descent.)</p>\n\n<p>But a belief in biological race also obscures the very salient consequences of race as lived experience. Race may be a biological myth, a social construction, but it nonetheless remains very real. It can even have biological effects. African Americans have among the highest rates of hypertension in the world. This was long assumed to be genetic, a \"marker\" of their nature. But then it was found that West Africans have among the world's lowest hypertension rates. A focus on race as innate biology, as genetic difference, would lead health professionals and policy makers to overlook social factors that might contribute to African American hypertension and heart disease, including the added stressor of living in a racist society.Â </p>\n\n<p>Race is terribly relevant to life outcomes. The likelihood that toxic waste has been dumped in your neighborhood, your ability to get a home loan, the quality of your kid's education, connections to job opportunities, whether or not you're likely to be followed in a department store or pulled over by police, are all influenced by your race. Race does matter. Not race as genetics but race as lived experience, what sociologists call \"social\" race. Social race is an important variable for health researchers and epidemiologists.</p>\n\n<p>The factors that lead to differential outcomes between races live not in any \"racial\" genes but in our social institutions and practices. It's easy to confuse the two. But doing so, like Dr. Cartwright's drapetomania, displaces our attention from those discriminatory practices to the \"nature\" of the victims. Blindness to the continuing impact of racism can be just as harmful as believing that race is biologically real. They both let society off the hook.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"title":"Victoria Robinson shares how she uses her favorite clip on redlining in her teaching","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/280782466","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4580576fe9e74f76d3dae0589b93547e-ef1f6d2046a823c9596262bed16a9fda.png"}}}}],"interviews":[{"__typename":"node__interview","title":"Interview with Ira Berlin","changed":1528242745,"field_interviewee_name":{"processed":"Ira Berlin"},"field_interviewee_bio":{"processed":"Ira Berlin is Distinguished University Professor of History at the University of Maryland.

What do they need to do so profitably?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Jamestown settlers came here to get rich. And it takes them a while. They go through a rough time called The Starving Time in Virginia - which indeed is a rather desperate period. But eventually they discover a commodity, tobacco, which does what they hope it will do. It is not nearly as profitable as sugar. But it is profitable. And that of course transforms Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>We call that the Tobacco Revolution and it transforms Virginia from a very marginal kind of society to a society in which some people can get very, very rich. And of course what they need to get very, very rich is labor. But labor is in very short supply in the New World. It is in particularly short supply in Virginia because a good part of the Native American population has already died off because of warfare with these invaders and in larger measure because of disease. The microbes turn out to be extraordinarily efficient and the people of the New World don't have resistance to a variety of European diseases.</p>\n\n<p>So these potential tobacco barons need labor. And they will pretty much take it wherever they can, wherever they can get it. One source of course is the Native American population, and they try to use them as laborers. Another source is the European population and they will use them as laborers, as free labor but also coerced labor, so-called Indentured Servants. Indentured servants are people who are essentially enslaved for a period of years. And they will also call upon Africans as laborers.</p>\n\n<p>What is interesting about what happens in Virginia is that the Virginians, and also other peoples in the Chesapeake region, in Maryland as well, do not establish the system of slavery immediately. The system is rather open. And many of these people who are of African descent who enter Virginia fall into the status of indentured servants.</p>\n\n<p>Some people of African descent escape from these forms of coerced labor, and begin to behave pretty much like everybody else in the Chesapeake - that is, they try to gain access to some land and some labor to work the land, whether it is free or coerced, whether it is indentured or enslaved. And once they do they begin to do pretty well for themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What were the differences that made a difference in early Virginia?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 17th century Chesapeake area is indeed a multi-racial society. Native Americans, people of African descent, and people of European descent are jumbled up in a variety of ways and they do the kinds of things that people do when they get jumbled up together: They work together. They play together. They fight. They sleep together.</p>\n\n<p>And until we get the formation of plantations, until we get this new institution which demands labor and benefits from squeezing people and wringing out of them as much work as you possibly can, the behavior and the interaction of Europeans and Africans and Native Americans is remarkably open.</p>\n\n<p>They distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. They distinguish themselves by religion - differences between Protestants and Catholics of course are of enormous significance. They distinguish themselves by nationality - distinguishing between Dutch and French and English and Iberian peoples. And of course the English people distinguish between themselves and Scotch and Welsh. And all of them distinguish themselves from the Irish, who are viewed as yet another case entirely from the English perspective.</p>\n\n<p>But however they distinguish themselves, they are arranged in a hierarchical order in which a few are on top and many are on bottom. Hierarchy is ubiquitous in this world. The Kingdom is a hierarchy; there is only one king. The church is a hierarchy, whether you view it from the perspective of Rome and the pope, or whether you view it from the perspective of Canterbury and the Archbishop. The army is a hierarchy, with a general in charge. Wealth is distributed in a hierarchical way. And most importantly, the family is a hierarchy in which the father stands at the head.</p>\n\n<p>And the idea of the father writ large as the pope, as the king, as the general, is something which unites all of these hierarchies - and makes the notion that hierarchy is providential. It's the way God ordered the world. So some people are on the top and others on the bottom. Whether they are indentured servants, slaves, or property-less, free laborers, it's not viewed as anything unusual.</p>\n\n<p>These providential hierarchies, of course, is what distinguishes this world from the radically different world of post- July 4th 1776 when suddenly equality becomes the standard currency. And the new presumption is that all men are created equal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Bacon's Rebellion mark a turning point in American ideas of race, giving birth to, as Edmund Morgan says, both black slavery and American freedom?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bacon's Rebellion is an event which begins to redefine notions of race on the North American continent, or at least in the Chesapeake region.</p>\n\n<p>Before Bacon's Rebellion we certainly have distinctions made between blacks and whites, and we certainly have attitudes on the part of whites and presumably on the part of blacks where they differentiate themselves and where they probably think each is superior to the other.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we see them behaving pretty much the same way. Some numbers of people of African descent have moved into the land owning class, are sometimes owning the servants, are connected with churches, are cognizant of the legal system and so on.</p>\n\n<p>And of course substantial numbers of people of European descent are caught in a system of coerced labor called indentured servitude. And indentured servants, whether they are black or white, are pretty much treated the same way as slaves. Very badly.</p>\n\n<p>Bacon's Rebellion changes that, and what seems to be crucial in changing that is the consolidation after Bacon's Rebellion of a planter class. The planters had not been able to control this rowdy labor force of servants and slaves. But soon after Bacon's Rebellion they increasingly distinguish between people of African descent and people of European descent. They enact laws which say that people of African descent are hereditary slaves. And they increasingly give some power to white independent white farmers and land holders.</p>\n\n<p>That increased power is not equality. Dirt farmers are not elected to the House of Burgess in Virginia; the planters monopolize those offices. But they do participate in the political system. In other words we see slavery and freedom being invented at the same moment.</p>\n\n<p>Now what is interesting about this is that we normally say that slavery and freedom are opposite things -that they are diametrically opposed. But what we see here in Virginia in the late 17th century, around Bacon's Rebellion, is that freedom and slavery are created at the same moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do racial ideas change after Bacon's Rebellion?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What interests us here is how that sense of Otherness continually gains new and different meanings over time and place. In Virginia prior to Bacon's Rebellion we had a much more open system. We have black planters and white planters, black indentured servants and slaves, we have white people who are indentured servants and living in un-freedom.</p>\n\n<p>In that kind of world, distinctions between black and white are of course made. But very few people talk about black people as being stupid or dull or ignorant or dirty or lazy. When they speak of Anthony Johnson [a black planter] there may be disdain in their voice, but generally it is that perhaps he is too clever, he is manipulative. He is untrustworthy. He is a little bit too smooth for them. But somebody like Anthony Johnson has been so successful that it would be foolish to denounce him as stupid or lazy or unproductive.</p>\n\n<p>When we move into the post-Bacon's Rebellion world where slavery and the plantation economy are in place, where black people are arriving in large numbers from Africa, the view of black people changes very rapidly. It is not simply slavery that transforms notions of race. It is this plantation slavery, the advent of the plantation and disciplined, exploitative labor that begins to transform notions of race.</p>\n\n<p>And it is that which I am concerned with here. It's not the origins of ideas of race but how race is continually transformed and given different meanings in different circumstances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did Africans become the slaves of choice in North America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question of why Africans become the people of choice to be enslaved in the New World is a question that doesn't have a simple answer. Or it certainly doesn't have an agreed upon answer. There is certainly a great need for labor in the New World, generally because the Native American peoples die at enormous rates when confronted with the diseases of the Old World, be it African or be it European.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways what we see taking place after Christopher Columbus in the post Columbian world, is a re-peopling of the world because of the enormous mortality rates and the holocaust of Native American peoples.</p>\n\n<p>But still, we had a choice of laborers - so why not the European laborers? We know that Europeans have no problem chopping each other up into small pieces in a series of wars. The Protestants don't like Catholics and Catholics don't like Protestants. And from the English perspective, there seems to be one particular population that does in fact seem slavish or appropriate to enslave. And they, of course, are the Irish.</p>\n\n<p>It is precisely at the same time that the English are settling the New World that they are conquering Ireland. They do so with all of the brutality of the destruction of Native American peoples. And they do so with all of the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade.</p>\n\n<p>The Irish are viewed as a lesser people because they have a kind of semi- nomadic existence. They are viewed as lesser people because of their organization into clans. They are viewed as a lesser people because they are not simply heathen they are something worse than heathen from the English perspective: they are Catholic.</p>\n\n<p>So it is a real question in the 17th century why the English enslave Africans. And I don't think there is an easy or an agreed upon answer to that. Some claim that the question turns upon color distinctions, that there are certain things you can't do to people of European descent, of white skin.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I am uncomfortable with those explanations. I think the explanation may lie more in accessibility, the ability to access slave labor. And then a certain precedent is established once the system is going. By the 17th century African slavery has existed for almost two centuries, which in some ways makes it easier to move against Africans than to move against people of European descent, and against the Irish.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When is slavery as an institution first challenged on ethical grounds?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The questioning of slavery as an institution is a new, radical and recent idea. Questioning the validity, the sanctity, the morality of the institution of slavery comes very, very late in the history of the world. Not till the end of the 18th century, not until the Age of Revolution do we see the institution of slavery questioned. Up until that time slavery is not only ubiquitous, slavery is sanctioned by the state, by the church, by the Christian bible, by the Koran, and by the various texts of other religions.</p>\n\n<p>So this questioning of slavery is a radical departure from the past. And it separates our modern world, in which slavery seems a ridiculously hateful, spiteful, backwards and oppressive institution, from the past. And so this becomes a major dividing point in human history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does Thomas Jefferson, the apostle of freedom, become the first prominent American to give voice to suspicions of innate black inferiority? Why do the new ideas of equality give rise to racial thinking?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thomas Jefferson is often thought of as a paradoxical figure. He is the great spokesman for equality, the author of the Declaration of Independence, a man seeped in the egalitarian revolutionary traditions of the late 18th century, and he likes to think of himself that way.</p>\n\n<p>Of course Jefferson was also a slave holder. And perhaps more than a slave holder. It is he perhaps more than anybody else in his Notes on the State of Virginia who first broaches it \"as a possibility,\" he says, that black people are different than white people, that Africans are different than Europeans.</p>\n\n<p>And this difference is not simply a product of circumstance, it is not simply a product of the environment but Jefferson broaches this possibility that it is something much deeper, something innate. We would say in our own language - Jefferson didn't have this language - we would say genetic. Jefferson thus in some ways becomes the father of a school of racial thought which of course stands in many ways in opposition to the great egalitarian tradition and this is viewed as a great paradox.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective it is not so much a paradox. It seems to me what we have is that Jefferson the egalitarian and the slaver holder perhaps more than anybody else is a person who has thought very deeply about this. He wrestles with these concerns. And his wrestling with these concerns takes him in a variety of directions.</p>\n\n<p>The American Revolution is an extraordinarily important event in world history. And combined with the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, the revolutions in Latin America, this Age of Revolution transforms not simply our own nation but transforms the world as well.</p>\n\n<p>After the American Revolution, after the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Declaration of Independence, the presumption is that all men are created equal. Equality is the point. And what then has to be explained for the very first time in world history is inequality. And why inequality exists. In other words, if all men are created equal, why are some men and women still slaves?</p>\n\n<p>And the explanation for the persistence of slavery can be: \"Well, perhaps there is something wrong with that notion of equality.\" In which case the whole notion of the post Revolutionary world, the whole notion of American nationality, is also wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Or the explanation can be: \"Perhaps these people who are enslaved are not quite men.\" And of course that leads us to a whole sea change in terms of racial thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, the American Revolution gives rise to a tradition of freedom AND a tradition of racialization?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The American Revolution becomes a critical marker in our understanding of America's racial history. From the American Revolution come these two great and oppositional traditions in American life.</p>\n\n<p>First are those people who take seriously the ideals of the American Revolution, that all men are created equal. And out of that radical egalitarian tradition comes the tradition of racial equality, comes the tradition of abolition, and many other egalitarian traditions.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways the great spokesperson for this tradition are slaves and former slaves themselves - Richard Allen to Frederick Douglass through Martin Luther King. They become the great spokesmen for the American egalitarian tradition and continually hose us down with the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence, reminding us of our heritage.</p>\n\n<p>But also out of the Declaration of Independence comes a darker tradition. That tradition is saying that while we accept the notion that all men are created equal but then perhaps some of those people who are enslaved are not quite men. We will keep our ideas of American nationality but we will write certain people out of the human family.</p>\n\n<p>And that is a tradition which also developed and comes to fruition in the in the 19th century, in the great defenders of the institution of slavery, the opponents to emancipation, the protagonists of segregation and Jim Crow.</p>\n\n<p>And so again, this one moment when we become a nation, becomes critical for our understanding of both American nationality and race. Race and freedom are of one piece, are born at that same moment. And that is why we are continually struggling with it all the way into the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do anti-black prejudices grow into an ideology of white supremacy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 19th century is a period of radical transformation of slavery. And with the radical transformation of slavery comes a radical transformation of ideas about race. Some of those ideas are a product of the slave holder's response to the growing anti-slavery movement. Public opinion throughout the world is turning against the institution of slavery. Slaveholders have to defend this institution of slavery in new ways.</p>\n\n<p>And this pushes them to new ideas about race. They start talking about the childlike nature of slaves, simple folk incapable of full adulthood, of protecting themselves, in need of a master. Hence slavery, they claim, is a benevolent institution. Very, very few slaveholders spoke about their slaves that way in the 18th century.</p>\n\n<p>Some slaveholders seemed to go in the opposite direction, depicting slaves as inhuman beasts, always ready to revolt, to plant a hatchet in the back of their owner's head. So, if we have the image of the slave child, we also have the image of the slave beast. They too are in need of a master lest they run rough-shod over society raping, pillaging, destroying civilization. So notions about race don't remain constant. They are constantly changing. And in some measure they are constantly changing because the institution of slavery itself is constantly changing.</p>\n\n<p>And it is that connection between the structure of slavery and how the institution works, and how masters and slaves struggle against each other, which of course is part of the way in which ideas about race are redefined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why doesn't the abolition of slavery bring an end to anti-black feelings? Instead, racism becomes even more virulent at the end of the 19th century.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If one of the markers of America's racial history is the advent of the plantation, and another marker is the American Revolution, certainly the third stop is the Civil War and Reconstruction that follows. With the Civil War of course there is a reclaiming of the great egalitarian tradition, the great tradition of the revolution, and of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal.</p>\n\n<p>It is upon that foundation upon which emancipation rests. Indeed, one of the things that we see both during the Civil War in the northern states and after the Civil War throughout the nation is a real recession of the color line, a real redrawing of lines in attitudes, in ideas, in laws, that are passed. Which open up the society to equal participation in a variety of different ways.</p>\n\n<p>Black people of course are freed, they are made citizens, they participate in the great triumph of the Union. Some 200,000 black men fight in the Union army. That gives them a claim to citizenship that they continue to advertise and which in some measure is recognized.</p>\n\n<p>Reconstruction immediately following the Civil War is a great egalitarian experiment and its successes are numerous. It ultimately fails and of course in its wake comes Jim Crow, comes segregation, comes lynching as well. And with that comes another transformation of notions of race, transformations which in some ways draw perhaps even a harder line between white and black, draw even meaner racial distinctions.</p>\n\n<p>Slavery, for whatever else it was, brought white people and black people together; they had to work together. It made no sense to segregate a slave. By defining a person as a slave you already distinguished them from a free person, distinguished white from black.</p>\n\n<p>But once those legal distinctions disappeared and if you wanted to maintain the social distinctions, you had to create a whole other set of institutions which are eventually called segregation. Moreover, since the line between black and white was no longer hedged by the institution of slavery, you had to create other fences, other barriers to make sure you couldn't confuse a white and black. After all, black people were now citizens of this nation. They had all of the rights of citizens; you had to find ways to either eliminate those rights or to make sure that they were not exercised.</p>\n\n<p>And of course this unleashes an enormous amount of violence, violence that is in some ways implicit in the institution of slavery, but must be explicit in maintaining the distinctions between whites and blacks in the post-Emancipation world. And the more competitive that blacks become with white people, of course, the more dangerous they seem.</p>\n\n<p>One of the interesting things is that many of the institutions that develop in the post-Reconstruction United States had their origins not so much in the slave South but in the free North. It is in the North where the first system of segregation first begins. It is there where race riots first appear. These institutions of course in some ways are superfluous to a slave society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weren't 19th century European immigrants 'raced'?</strong></p>\n\n<p>During the late 19th century the nature of immigration to the Americas changes. The 17th and 18th centuries are the great centuries of African migration. The overwhelming majority of people who come to the New World before 1800 are Africans. In the 19th century that changes. The slave trade is closed and European immigration ultimately becomes the dominant form of immigration.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these European peoples are at the bottom of American society. They are the workers and they are the day laborers, and they are factory workers in particular.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the things which are said about these European workers are the same thing which are said at various times about people of African descent. Despite the fact that they are working people, they are lazy. They are untrustworthy. They can't show up to the factory on time. They are undisciplined. They are improvident. And all of these things attach themselves at various times to a whole series of European peoples, beginning with the Irish, then Germans in the 1860s, then a whole series of eastern Europeans and northern Europeans - Italians, Slavs, and Nordic people as well.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways this is a process of racialization, of defining people at the bottom as Others. One of the ways of course that these new immigrants try to protect themselves is to distinguish themselves from that furthest pole of Otherness. They to try to distinguish themselves from black people. And in the process of doing this, they often adopt the very language which is used against them.</p>\n\n<p>So, once again, we have these two great traditions. One tradition of equality coming out of the Declaration of Independence and this is a tradition that many immigrant and working peoples identify themselves with. And then there is that other tradition of defining people as Others - that is, separating them out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does it mean to be an American?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Defining ourselves as a people means defining who is in but it also means defining who is out. These are reciprocal processes.</p>\n\n<p>I think for all of us it begins with the Declaration of Independence. It begins with Jefferson's great promise of American nationality. And extends through the Abolitionist Movement, through the Feminist Movement, through the Labor Movement, and an attempt in some ways to fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence. The struggle for emancipation during the Civil War is part of this struggle. So is the struggle for decent wages, the Civil Rights Movement. We define who we are by identifying our values and saying collectively that this is what we believe.</p>\n\n<p>But at the very same time when we are doing this we are also defining who we are not. And defining who we are not means sometimes defining groups of people as the Other. Sometimes it means demonizing other people as we distinguish ourselves from them.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that what is most painful about this process is that these are two sides to the same coin. The very process of defining who is in also is a process of defining who is out. And hence an Other maybe will always be with us. Even as we try to celebrate what is best and what is most universal in American life.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"87c58c4e-4709-4389-be59-c7380951a2ac","name":"Making Whiteness: Assimilation into Whiteness","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}},{"id":"5f13c4cd-25f4-4114-bf5f-bf3063cb9704","name":"Founding Race: Enslavement and Indian Removal","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}},{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Colonialism","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Slavery, and the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/9ce2075939e2d48f0db2848fde0b0af5-9972893df12cce8eba77938c24d03308.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Why are there different levels of advancement in varying countries by race?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>First of all, what we're dealing with here are assumptions based on western education.

What are the benefits or the advantages to being white in a society that has historically given benefits and advantages to members of the dominant group? If you are a person who has that privilege, you don't necessarily notice it. It is sometimes taken for granted. Let's use the example of racial profiling. If you're driving on the highway and you are not randomly stopped, you don't get to the end of your drive and say, \"Gee, I wasn't randomly stopped today.\" You just take for granted that you got in your car, drove to your destination, without incident, like you do most days. It's not something that you think of as a function of being a white person in this society, you know?</p>\n\n<p>If you go looking for an apartment and you find the apartment you like, and you rent it without difficulty, you don't say, \"Gee, I benefited from being white today. I got that apartment I wanted.\" If you go shopping in the grocery store and find hair care products and make-up that work for you, you don't think, \"Gee, I'm benefiting from being white today. The hair care products I need and the make-up I want were readily available for me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Can I find opportunities to express my culture if I'm of Asian or Latino descent? How often during the course of a day will I be asked if I speak English, or how long I've been in this country? Will the physical symbol of my face always mark me as a foreigner? These are not things that white people think about on a day-to-day basis - they just take it for granted.</p>\n\n<p>In one of my courses at Holyoke, \"The Psychology of Racism,\" I ask students on the first day of class to get in small groups and talk about themselves in terms of their own racial or ethnic backgrounds. In one of my sessions, that there was a young white woman in a small group talking about these issues, and she was struggling with how to describe herself in terms of her race or ethnicity. Finally she said, \"I'm just normal.\"</p>\n\n<p>When asked what did she mean in that context, she said, \"You know, I lived in an all-white neighborhood. I grew up with people a lot like myself, and I was just like everybody else - I was just the norm.\"</p>\n\n<p>What I think is so significant about her choice of words - to say \"I'm just normal\" - is that it implies that those around you, who weren't from that background, are \"abnormal.\" She never would have said that, but it is embedded in how we think.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does a person support racist systems without being personally racist?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people say \"But I'm not racist. I don't have prejudiced beliefs. As a white person, am I racist, simply because I live in a society in which I'm systematically advantaged?\"</p>\n\n<p>For me the relevant issue is not, \"Are you racist?\" but are you actively working against that system of advantage? Active racism is what I think many people would stereotypically think of as \"racist behavior\": name-calling, acts of racial violence, intentional discrimination, cross burning, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a lot of behavior that also supports a system of advantage that we might describe as passively racist. For example, in education - if I am teaching a course in which I exclude the contributions of people of color, only talk about white people's contributions and only talk about white literature. And I never introduce my students to the work of African Americans, Latinos or Native Americans. I may not be doing that with the intention of promoting a sense of cultural superiority, but in fact the outcome of leaving those contributions out is to reinforce the idea that only white people have made positive cultural contributions.</p>\n\n<p>I know a young woman who went to her English professor and asked, \"Why is it that there are only white writers on our list? This is a 20th Century American Literature course. How come there aren't any writers of color?\" Her professor, to his credit, was quite honest and said I'm teaching the authors I studied in graduate school. It wasn't malice on his part. He didn't wake up one day and say, \"Over my dead body will there be writers of color on my syllabus.\" He was simply teaching the authors with whom he was most familiar.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of individuals supporting racist systems can be found in our lending institutions. I might be an individual loan officer who considers herself to be quite progressive, very open minded; a person with limited, if any, prejudice. And yet I might work for a bank that has the practice of charging higher percentage rates to people who live in particular neighborhoods - specifically neighborhoods that have been redlined. So when a person of color from that neighborhood comes to see me, my own inclination might be to give that person a favorable loan. But if the policy of the bank is to give loans at a particular rate in a particular neighborhood, I might enact that policy, apart from my individual attitude, and in my decision-making reinforce the institutional racism embedded in that practice.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to interrupt these cycles, we have to be quite intentional about it. Even without any malicious intents, such passive acts of giving into certain institutions or traditions will perpetuate systems of advantage based on race.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the obstacles to an equal society? Why can't we be \"colorblind\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Does creating more equitable environments mean loss for some people? That's what the controversy around issues like affirmative action is about. It feels like a loss, people feel like opportunities are being taken away from them. They don't necessarily see that there is a gain for the whole society, and perhaps even for them, by creating opportunities for everybody to contribute more fairly. It's not just about taking things away, it's about creating a better environment for everyone. A safer environment - a more just environment is a more peaceful environment. Martin Luther King said there is no peace without justice. We live in a world that is increasingly torn by violence, not always described as racially motivated violence, but violence which is very much related to systems of oppression. And to the extent that we're able to interrupt those systems, we're able to create a better quality of life for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the problem is that people often struggle with the concept of meritocracy. They grow up with this notion that we live in a meritocracy, that people get what they deserve. It is an idea that has been part of their socialization. And to understand racism, or sexism or classism, or other isms as systems of advantage based on race or social group membership - these really fly in the face of that notion of meritocracy.</p>\n\n<p>Think about the government assistance in home financing that took place for the World War II generation in the 1950's. Who got access to those loans? Where were those new houses being built? In the suburbs. And what resulted from the racially-restrictive covenants that blocked access to that new housing for people of color? If you got a government loan with your GI Bill and bought a house in an all-white area and that house appreciated in value - that was all made more available to you as consequence of racist policies and practices. To the child of that parent, it looks like my father worked hard, bought a house, passed his wealth on to me, made it possible for me to go to school, mortgaged that house so I could have a relatively debt-free college experience, and has financed my college education. How come your father didn't do that? Well, there are some good reasons why maybe your father might have had a harder time doing that if you're African American or Latino or Native American, or even Asian American.</p>\n\n<p>The best response to the colorblind notion I have ever heard came to me from an African American father who I was interviewing for a study I was doing on the experiences of black youth in predominantly white communities.</p>\n\n<p>He was talking about his experiences with his children in school. They were often the only black children in a mostly white class. And he talked about the teachers who would say something like, \"I'm color blind. I treat all the kids the same, all the children the same.\"</p>\n\n<p>And his response was, \"The same as what? The same as if they were all white? My children, as the only black children in the class, are not having the same experience as the white children in that class. The white children are seeing themselves reflected in the schoolbooks, in the classroom teacher. My children are sometimes called names that white children don't hear themselves being called. Their experience is not the same. So for you to say you're colorblind, that you're treating the children all the same, is to say that you're not acknowledging the reality of my child's day-to-day experience, and that feels very invalidating.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Doesn't the existence of multicultural curricula in the United States prove that we're making progress?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We use diversity as an umbrella term to describe the differences among people - whether those differences are cultural, religious, socioeconomic, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, etc. When we think about the benefits of diversity, I think we have to think about the fact that we are not interested in bringing people together just so we can say, \"I know somebody who is different from me.\" It's not just about getting to know people as friends, though certainly there can be very important and useful friendships that emerge in diverse environments. But when I think about diversity and the value of it, I think about really different approaches to problem solving, different approaches to thinking about our society that might lead us to more equitable systems, the various talents that people bring.</p>\n\n<p>In some schools they try to address diversity through what we might describe as a celebration of heroes and holidays. We are going to talk about Martin Luther King in January or February. We are going to have this day where we are celebrating holidays and people are going to bring in foods from different backgrounds, and it's a fairly superficial discussion of diversity, without really engaging in the meaning of that diversity in people's lives.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, as an African American, I might come to school and talk about the holiday Kwaanza as part of diversity celebrations in the school. I happen to be in a family where we do celebrate Kwaanza as well as Christmas. However, if that is all we talk about in terms of my heritage, then I would feel like we had missed the boat. We have to be clear that it's not just understanding that he eats beans and rice, and she eats egg rolls and this person celebrates Kwanza. It's not about that. It is also about understanding the history of the way those groups have been treated in our society, and what we need to do to interrupt that history; to interrupt that current situation in terms of making sure that everybody has equal access.</p>\n\n<p>So it's not just understanding somebody's heroes and holidays, but it's also understanding issues of social justice and how the society operates in ways that systematically advantages some members of our community, and systematically disadvantages other members of our community.</p>\n\n<p>And if we can use our understanding of diversity in those terms and can connect with one another as allies working towards a more socially just environment, then I think we have really maximized the benefit of diversity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does racism affect everyone?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I speak to audiences about this topic of race and racism, one of the questions that I often ask is for them to reflect on their own earliest race-related memory. In general, you can say that people of color tend to have earlier memories - particularly if they grew up in the United States - than those who are white. Having said that, when you ask them what emotion is associated with this early memory, almost everyone, both people of color and white people, will talk about things like fear, anger, sadness, shame, embarrassment, sometimes guilt.</p>\n\n<p>What's really striking to me about this is not only do so many people have this experience, but when asked if they had discussed their experience with an adult or a parent or a teacher at the time, many people said they did not. They already knew that it was a topic you weren't supposed to talk about. Somehow the adults in the environment had communicated to them that this is something we don't discuss. Sometimes the people of color will say I was upset by what happened to me, and I was too embarrassed to tell anybody else about it. Sometime white adults will say that it was a trusted adult who was the source of the confusion. One of the things that makes the process so insidious is that it comes from people we know, love and trust. It's your mother who rented the videotape that was full of stereotypical images. It's your favorite uncle who tells the jokes at Thanksgiving. It's your next door neighbor who makes the casual comments that imbeds. It's your favorite English teacher who leaves writers of color off the syllabus.</p>\n\n<p>What's really significant to me about this is not only that people have these negative experiences, but they've also internalized the idea that we shouldn't talk about it. And that, I think, is really problematic if we are ever going to get beyond the issue of racism as an impediment to social justice in our society because we have to be able to talk about it order to move beyond it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do some people voluntarily separate themselves socially based on race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People are naturally drawn to people who they see as being familiar. However, if you want to connect with somebody who is different from yourself, you have to be able to understand where is that person coming from. And one of the things that I've observed when we talk about, for example, racial group differences, is that students of color often come already thinking about themselves as members of particular groups. Whereas white students don't necessarily come to college thinking of themselves as quote white.</p>\n\n<p>That, I think, is important in terms of how young people are coming together. Because if I'm coming to school thinking about myself as African American, or Latina, or African American, and I'm interacting with white students -- many of whom may have grown up thinking that the thing to do is to be colorblind. And that white student, in her effort to connect with me, says something like, \"Gee, I don't think of you as a black person.\" Or, \"Why do you put so much emphasis on being a Latina?\" Or, \"Why is being African American so important to you?\"</p>\n\n<p>And if that is a very important part of my adolescent identity development process, just asking me that question is going to signal to me that you don't get it, that you don't understand where I'm coming from. Then I have to decide do I want to explain myself to you, or not? I might be willing to explain, once or twice. But if I find that everybody I meet outside of my group needs an explanation, that might get a little old. I might get tired of that.</p>\n\n<p>So I might choose to hang around with people to whom I don't have to explain why I wear my hair the way I do, or why I like to listen to this kind of music as opposed to that kind of music. Or why I speak Spanish on the phone to my mother. That if I don't want to explain certain parts of myself frequently, I might choose to hang around with people who are similar to me. And that's an understandable response.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, identity questions really start to come to the surface during adolescence. That's when young people really start to think, \"Who am I? What do I want to be when I grow up? How do I want to interact with other people in the world? Who do I want to connect with?\" All of these are questions about identity.</p>\n\n<p>But when you talk to young people of color, many of their identity questions are linked to their sense of themselves as members of a particular racial or ethnic group; not only who am I, but who am I as an African American woman? Who am I as an African American male? Who am I as a Latina? Who am I as a Cherokee? When you talk to young white people, they may be thinking about who they are and who they want to relate to, and how they want to think about themselves in the world. But it may not necessarily be linked to their sense of what it means to be white - particularly if they've grown up in a predominantly white community, or gone to predominantly white schools.</p>\n\n<p>Now you might ask why do so many young people of color think about their racial group membership? If white kids aren't thinking about it, why are kids of color thinking about it? And one of the reasons they're thinking about it is because other people bring it to their attention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do cultural influences (television, media, etc.) make whiteness the norm and people of color \"the other\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Certainly if we're talking about white people living in predominantly white communities, it is certainly true that many people will grow up without having direct contact with people of color. And because they don't have that direct contact, the information that they have is coming to them largely from second hand sources; maybe from the television they've watched, the movies they've seen, the jokes they hear people tell, the casual comments they hear relatives making. So that the information is coming in stereotyped packages, typically.</p>\n\n<p>One of the problems with stereotyping and the self-fulfilling nature of it, is that if you've heard these things, and then you meet somebody, you are likely to look for those characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly if we think about how young children begin to understand race and the images that they are exposed to, we can say that white children receive many images in which they see themselves reflected. Their parents go to the library, they check out library books, and they see white children in them. They watch television, they see white children playing. Which is not to say they never see messages or images of people of color, but they're seeing lots of white images -- not only on television but in their homes, in their families, in their neighborhoods. So as a consequence of that, they will tend to think of white as the norm.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that we know about white children is that they often express curiosity about that which they perceive as different. You know, the white child in the grocery store who might see a dark-skinned person for the first time saying, \"Mommy, mommy, why is that person so dark?\" They're not asking, \"Mommy, mommy, why are we so light?\" The question is framed in terms of the other.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, young children of color growing up, even if they live in environments that are fairly homogenous - black kids growing up in black neighborhoods, Latino children in Latino neighborhoods, etc. - are going to also be bombarded with images of white people in the media, in the books they get from the library, in the television they watch. So that even though they may be surrounded by a community in which they see themselves reflected, in terms of the bigger society, they, too, are also watching the same television programs, reading the same children's books, exposed to the same curricula in school, etc. So children of color don't necessarily start out asking why do white people look the way they do, but why do I look the way I do? Young children come to understand the wider world in terms as one that is dominated by white people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can we have control over racial stereotypes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"The Lion King\" was a very popular film, and my kids saw it more than once, I will confess. However, when I watched it with them, I pointed out some concerns I had. I told my children that I was bothered by the fact that the hyenas - who were the bad guys of the film - have voices that make them sound like black people and Spanish speaking people. Now, some people would say I'm making too much of that. But think about the fact that young children watch movies like this repeatedly and these messages are seen over and over again. They do have an effect on how we view others.</p>\n\n<p>Now, am I saying that you should never let your children see a film that has a stereotype in it? No. What I'm saying is that you need to help your kids think critically about them so they can recognize them as stereotypes and think critically about whether they make sense or not.</p>\n\n<p>Once, while we were driving through a city not far from where we live, my son saw a young black man running down the street. He said to me, \"Why is that kid running?\" I said, \"I don't know why he's running. Why do you think he's running?\" And my son said, \"Maybe he stole something.\" And I was horrified to hear him make that comment. Where would he have gotten that idea?</p>\n\n<p>So I said, \"Well, what would make you think so?\" He said, \"You know, we're in a city. Sometimes people in cities steal things.\" And I pointed out that we have been in the city many times, parked our car, and never had a problem. I've had one thing stolen from my car in my life, and that happened in the small town, predominantly white, in which I live now. Well clearly he sees the nightly news. He watches television. He had absorbed those messages.</p>\n\n<p>Books, computer games, the Web, television - there are so many places that we can be exposed to stereotypes, that we can be exposed to distorted information. And there is a whole universe of information that we're not getting. Think about these stereotypes, these omissions, these distortions as a kind of environment that surrounds us, like smog in the air. We don't breathe it because we like it. We don't breathe it because we think it's good for us. We breathe it because it's the only air that's available.</p>\n\n<p>And in the same way, we're taking in misinformation not because we want it. When you or your child sits in front of the television on Saturday morning watching cartoons, you're not saying let's have our daily diet of stereotypes today. But you're being exposed to them because they're just there, in the commercials, in the images that you're watching. And it's so pervasive that you don't even notice it sometimes. In fact, a lot of the time you don't notice it.</p>\n\n<p>We're all breathing in misinformation. We're all being exposed to stereotypes, and we all have to think about how we have been impacted by that. You sometimes hear people say there is not a prejudiced bone in my body. But I think when somebody makes that statement, we might gently say to them check again. That if we have all been breathing in smog, we can't help but have have our thinking shaped by it somehow. As a consequence, we all have work to do. Whether you identify as a person of color, whether you identify as a white person, it doesn't matter. We all have been exposed to misinformation that we have to think critically about.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"White privilege","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}},{"title":"A Long History of Racial Preferences: For Whites","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>'Colorblind'Â policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action.Â But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-codedÂ practices have enabled white Americans.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/ab4690dfbce44c9414a5efd011ceac7e-8fd8740226c51ef8372e0937112a4b0f.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.

Actually, a new study of incarceration and race shows that one in eight black men between the ages of 20 and 40 were jailed last year, in comparison to one out of 63 white men from that age group.</p>\n\n<p>Now, most revealing here is that the greatest increase in incarceration has come from the war on drugs. Something like three quarters of the half million people jailed for drug possession are black or Latino, despite the fact that rates of drug use are about the same in all ethnic or racial groups. Whites use drugs just as much as others do. I came from a relatively affluent white community where lots of kids were doing drugs, but they weren't going to jail for many years for it. Rarely did these white kids or adults get caught, and when they did, they benefited from lenient policing or from different sentencing practices.</p>\n\n<p>In the media, you often read about this issue of single-family parenting and the importance of nuclear families. There is a lot of attention paid to these issues in terms of cultural difference. Yet as The Economist recently reported, western Europeans register higher rates of out-of-wedlock parenthood than do African Americans. Yet this phenomenon gets special attention only in the latter case. Furthermore, there's no evidence that people raised in what are commonly referred to as \"nuclear families\" actually fare better in absolute terms than those who grew up in more extended families. Despite a long, long history of African Americans' deep commitment to their families, both immediate and extended, there's this popular political discourse about how blacks lack family values; that this has been a major cause of poverty.</p>"},"changed":1532734255}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}}],"field_interviewee":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408.png","childImageSharp":{"id":"42a48b8c-e394-5f83-b503-798cf42893ec >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1148,"height":1076,"src":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408.png"},"sizes":{"src":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408-2fd78.png"},"resolutions":{"height":375,"width":400,"src":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408-37095.png"}}}}}}],"faqs":[{"__typename":"node__faq","id":"f6c30f34-2487-469a-aaec-c1fa99b07d21","title":"How is racism different from prejudice?","fields":{"slug":"how-is-racism-different-from-prejudice"},"field_title":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_question_summary":null,"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>I think prejudice is a matter of feeling; it's a hostile or dismissive attitude, a feeling toward people we find different from ourselves in some way, and some way that we take as significant, but racism is more than that.

Presumably, you can say how the person might think, how the person might react, his inclination, his physical abilities, all those kinds of things. And of course, you can't do anything about your race. You are whatever race you are judged to be.

First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time.

Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races. So, to try to make any judgments about one group versus another is extremely difficult when variation is the rule of the game. Abilities change through time.

First, all Americans - regardless of socioeconomic status or racial/ethnic background - would need to have equal opportunity to educate themselves, to pursue their professional goals, and to take care of themselves and their families. Second, all Americans would need to rise above the kinds of color-consciousness that perpetuate inequality. Yet there is little evidence, historical or contemporary, that we have met either of these requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Racial minorities have been denied access to jobs, capital, housing and educational resources throughout U.S. history and, of equal importance, are regularly denied access to this day. Institutions - both public and private - have played a critical role in determining which groups have benefited most in U.S. society, often giving whites an advantage at the expense of minorities. And those institutions continue to play this role, despite laws that forbid discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>They continue to play this role in part because of a related, and equally important, factor: Americans are acutely conscious of \"color,\" although they often have very different assumptions about its implications. For example, when nonwhites talk about \"race,\" \"multiculturalism,\" and \"colorblindness,\" they are much more likely to see questions of economic and political power as crucial variables. Whites, by contrast, tend to focus on the issues of \"prejudice,\" \"mutual understanding,\" and \"personal responsibility.\" Indeed whites often argue that if all people could \"look beyond\" race, then \"racial problems\" would go away. This emphasis on \"prejudice\" and \"understanding\" is important. It does not, however, address the role that power relations have long played in racial conflicts in the U.S., and the role that power has played in facilitating whites' relative success in American society.</p>\n\n<p>Why are there such different understandings of the \"difference that race makes?\" It is partly due to the fact that many Americans - especially white Americans - are deeply invested in the idea that individuals (or groups of individuals) are solely responsible for their own success or failure, and thus they attribute success or failure solely to a person's \"effort,\" \"culture,\" or \"values.\" Perhaps if all Americans were to engage in a more concrete, historically informed discussion about \"opportunity\" and \"achievement\" in the U.S., including the role that institutions have played (and continue to play) in shaping people's lives, we might have a very different understanding of \"race\" and its implications.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Dalton Conley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"David M.P.

I would argue that colorblindness generally perpetuates rather than challenges racism. Certainly there has been a long history of state-sanctioned white supremacy in this country. At one time, colorblindness may have been a legitimate strategy to counteract the formidable power of pseudo-scientific thinking that asserted the inherent biological inferiority of people of color. Today, however, advocates of colorblindness promote an understanding of racial inequality as individual \"prejudice\" devoid of historical context, thus preventing dialogue about more systemic kinds of oppression. The fact that colorblindness is so entrenched in court precedents, legislation, and policy-making testifies to our inability to achieve racial equality while stuck in a pre-civil rights understanding of race and racism.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps opponents of racial equality embrace colorblindness because eliminating race consciousness conveniently eliminates accountability for white supremacy. Witness the latest Ward Connerly incarnation in California: the so-called \"Racial Privacy Initiative\" that would eliminate collection of statistics that use racial categories. This \"colorblind\" initiative would relieve the state of any accountability for racial disadvantage.</p>\n\n<p>Are we ready for a colorblind society?

The first African brought to British North America came to Jamestown. Jamestown had been through a series of what were called \"starving times\" where substantial numbers of people died. They needed labor. They had stumbled upon this crop. They'd been looking for gold forever and discovered there wasn't a whole lot of gold in Virginia, but the closest they could find to gold was tobacco. But they needed labor to grow tobacco, and that tobacco became the support of the colony. Africans were available to provide the labor. They had the skill, by the way, to provide the labor. Therefore, the economic necessity of the time made it easy for those in Virginia and later those in all parts of the colonies, to kid themselves that in some way they were doing something that was not objectionable, that could be rationalized. In a word, we're talking avarice.</p>\n\n<p>For the generations that came afterward and maybe didn't have land or didn't need the labor, it served a different function.

So the situation is definitely changing. What hasn't changed enough is the tremendous difference in wealth between racial groups, particularly the net worth of families, which makes a big difference. So there are structural inequalities that are still with us that we have hardly begun to overcome at all. In fact, they don't seem to be closing; that's the problem. So you can have an Oprah, and you can have a Colin Powell and you can have a Condoleezza Rice, but you can still have a lot of people who just don't have any opportunities, because they don't have the economic resources to go anywhere in this society.</p>"},"changed":1531438943},{"title":"Are we ready for a \"colorblind\" society?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>I hope we're never ready for a \"colorblind\" society.

Affirmative action opponents play upon fears that proactive measures will become a politically inscribed remedy that society will never be rid of once they are put into place. Past practice has proven that that's just not the case.

First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time.

Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races.

Performance as we see it on the human stage changes through time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess the most important thing to say is that all of this assumes that race is a valid, analytical category. But, in fact, it really isn't a valid, analytical category. Science strives for generalizability. It wants a truth to look for, truths that are true not just for a specific study, but across time, across space.

First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time. And without at least some crude approximation of that, it's extremely hard to make all of these assumptions about what group outperforms another group. It's also not true to fact. Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races. So, to try to make any judgments about one group versus another is extremely difficult when variation is the rule of the game. Abilities change through time. Performance as we see it on the human stage changes through time.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the most important thing to say is that all of this assumes that race is a valid, analytical category. But, in fact, it really isn't a valid, analytical category. Science strives for generalizability. It wants a truth to look for, truths that are true not just for a specific study, but across time, across space. But, as we've previously discussed, race is a category without any sort of central tendency to it. It's a category that is always open to social definition. Always changing through time and place.

Many students of color do not have access to honors courses or AP courses in schools that are mostly serving whites. Why is that? What isn't talked about in the Michigan affirmative action case that's currently being decided by the Supreme Court, is that Michigan schools are the most segregated in the United States for African Americans, according to the Harvard Civil Rights Project. Therefore, students of color are not attending the schools with the high-level AP and honors courses for which the University of Michigan gives extra points. Yet no one really gets bent out of shape about those preferential points that clearly have a built-in racial advantage for whites and disadvantage African Americans.

Secondly, on the biological side, we've all come to realize the incredible amount of variation within any so-called race.

I think the state of racial politics in this country creates for many privileged people a really significant set of personal and political paradoxes.

And since the civil rights transformations of the 1950s and '60s, many privileged people, especially whites, think that by respecting the letter of civil rights law and by not engaging in obviously offensive acts of discrimination, they are playing by the rules and promoting equality. Here's the paradox, though: since so many of the mechanisms that discriminate, and so many of the mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are not obvious, many people are actually encouraging and perpetuating this inequality - this same inequality that they claim to oppose.

It's interesting - when a lot of people talk about race, they really want to focus on the individual instead of the larger social community. What is the individual's right, responsibility, etc.? But when you switch the terms of debate to something like nationalism or patriotism after 9-11, everyone suddenly wants to talk about community and about collective social responsibility.

Consider some of the most often cited causes for black or Hispanic poverty. You mentioned some: lack of investment in education, poor parenting, excessive substance abuse, domestic abuse, criminality, inability to save money. This might be a persuasive argument if, for example, the rates of substance abuse or domestic violence were statistically higher among the poor or among minorities. But they're not. They plague all communities - white and non-white, rich and poor - but have very different impacts on those communities because some people are largely immune to serious police action, because sentencing practices vary considerably by race, and because affluent people generally have many ways to hide these kinds of behaviors from public view.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one of the subgroups in the United States with the highest rate of spousal abuse is police officers. There's also a noticeable spike in reports of domestic violence this year in families of U.S. military personnel. Yet we don't see that fact alone plunging their families into poverty, nor do we see many exposÃ©s on the cultural values of the police and military communities on the evening news. Policing and sentencing practices are really crucial factors here, as well. Actually, a new study of incarceration and race shows that one in eight black men between the ages of 20 and 40 were jailed last year, in comparison to one out of 63 white men from that age group.</p>\n\n<p>Now, most revealing here is that the greatest increase in incarceration has come from the war on drugs.
