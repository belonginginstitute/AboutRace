If we take this view, it's not important whether a white family, or a black family for that matter, arrived in 1700 or in 1965. If we wear cotton blue jeans, if we took out an insurance policy from Aetna, if we buy anything from anyone who has a connection to the industries that were built on slavery, then we benefit from slavery. And since capitalism touches us all, we all bear the stain of slavery and likewise, if you're black in America, regardless of when your ancestors arrived, you live with the stigma of it. And so, if capitalism, compound interest, and the magic of money enables us to enjoy the wealth of America, we're implicated in its past as well.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>Let's try this inversion of the question: there are people who are in their late teens who have never been slaves, and yet they suffer as individuals because of the disadvantages from the legacy of slavery and white supremacy. Is that right, and is that fair? The legacy of slavery and white supremacy is still with us. I'll give you an example that is very tied to affirmative action admissions. Many students of color do not have access to honors courses or AP courses in schools that are mostly serving whites. Why is that? What isn't talked about in the Michigan affirmative action case that's currently being decided by the Supreme Court, is that Michigan schools are the most segregated in the United States for African Americans, according to the Harvard Civil Rights Project. Therefore, students of color are not attending the schools with the high-level AP and honors courses for which the University of Michigan gives extra points. Yet no one really gets bent out of shape about those preferential points that clearly have a built-in racial advantage for whites and disadvantage African Americans. It's really irrelevant if you were a slaveholder or a slave, because society still perpetuates these inequalities today. The continuing effect from this historical legacy is one reason why affirmative action policies are important.</p>\n\n<p>David Freund:<br />\nEven in so-called integrated schools, minority kids are often tracked into classes whereas Sumi said, they're not going to get access to that kind of training and have those kinds of opportunities.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"David Freund"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>In a way, this question illustrates how many people bring their assumptions and conflate a lot of different issues all at once. Nobody today owns slaves, so what's the relevance of this to college admissions? It's really the product of a lot of rhetoric that's been thrown out there by people who oppose affirmative action.</p>\n\n<p>Opponents of affirmative action often say that people should be judged as individuals. In terms of college admissions, what actually does it mean to be judged as an \"individual?\" We are all a product of a combination of social circumstances and individual abilities or achievement. There are a lot of things that go into being evaluated as an individual beyond race. As individuals we are also the product of our family experience, class background and any number of other things.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bbab267e-dda3-4f32-8c59-e02cb7a2e81a"}}
