Most of our evolution as a species took place in Africa. And during most of that time, people probably were not in contact with people who appeared extremely different from themselves. The morphological differences that we consider to be racial differences were not the kinds of differences that people were routinely exposed to. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that we would have evolved some innate focus on racial differences. On the other hand, there is a lot of evidence that we make very fine distinctions between, for instance, peoples of the Middle East or different tribal groups of the same race. People often perceive \"awful otherness\" in groups who look like themselves but who have different cultural practices or religious traditions. It's certainly not the case that human beings are inclined to be more friendly or accepting towards those we perceive as members of our same race.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Alan Goodman"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>The ancient Greek Herodotus says that the Ethiopians are the most beautiful people in the world.
