Racism is a whole set of beliefs about that which justifies those feelings and tries to make the case for differences that we find are innate, permanent, and are the basis for action, the basis for discrimination, or even for an institution that will be based on these differences. In other words, it tends to turn into a kind of inequality or hierarchy based on these ideas. So you've got to get the ideology in there for it to become racism rather than mere prejudice.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I would agree with George and Audrey, and add that prejudice can apply to lots of things, not only race. But racism is based on the assumption that race is an indicator of basic traits of character. That is, if you know a person's race, you can say a lot more than simply what race the person is. Presumably, you can say how the person might think, how the person might react, his inclination, his physical abilities, all those kinds of things. And of course, you can't do anything about your race. You are whatever race you are judged to be. Once society makes the construction, constructs race, you are a certain race depending upon certain physical, outwardly observable characteristics. Other kinds of prejudice may not have the same kind of impact that race does because of these readily observable characteristics.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f6c30f34-2487-469a-aaec-c1fa99b07d21"}}
