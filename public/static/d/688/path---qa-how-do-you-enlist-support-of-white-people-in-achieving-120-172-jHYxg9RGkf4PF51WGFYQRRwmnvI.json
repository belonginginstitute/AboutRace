I think the state of racial politics in this country creates for many privileged people a really significant set of personal and political paradoxes. Most people declare their support for the theory of racial equality: rights and privileges, opportunity, fair treatment. And since the civil rights transformations of the 1950s and '60s, many privileged people, especially whites, think that by respecting the letter of civil rights law and by not engaging in obviously offensive acts of discrimination, they are playing by the rules and promoting equality. Here's the paradox, though: since so many of the mechanisms that discriminate, and so many of the mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are not obvious, many people are actually encouraging and perpetuating this inequality - this same inequality that they claim to oppose. So while many people feel strongly that they are not racist, they nonetheless help perpetuate racial inequality, perhaps unknowingly.

People of color have always organized to protest against racism, and by doing so they have been instrumental in creating a nation that's actually more fair and democratic.

So what happens in political debates and in daily life when whites and others ignore these things, when they insist that there is real equality of opportunity? What happens when people who are in these positions of racial privilege ignore inequality or attribute them to culture or effort? If whites and non-whites, generally speaking, have very different interpretations of the meaning of race in the U.S., it is not a very good recipe for real civic debate and for living in a multi-ethnic or multi-racial country. I think that one step towards enlisting people who might lose some of their privileges is to get them to consider this paradox and the impact this paradox has on the culture and politics of race relations in their daily lives.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think that people in positions of relative privilege, especially racial privilege, need to initiate debates over racial equality.

First, self-interest: Think of a boiling pot ready to explode. If you continue down this path of wealth inequality and continued hyper-incarceration and other forms of racial oppression, something's going to blow eventually. So, it's in your interest to rectify it. Number two, your sense of efficiency in the free market: We're losing qualified brain surgeons because we're not educating everyone to their fullest potential. Thirdly, the moral argument: What do you believe in? Are you just out for yourself or are you interested in a fair society, in a just society?</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Dalton Conley"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>David said something very important at the beginning. The whole 1960s notion was about civil rights, not race rights. We have to get back to the idea of a civil society, as Dalton is suggesting. It's interesting - when a lot of people talk about race, they really want to focus on the individual instead of the larger social community. What is the individual's right, responsibility, etc.? But when you switch the terms of debate to something like nationalism or patriotism after 9-11, everyone suddenly wants to talk about community and about collective social responsibility. So there's this weird sort of paradox in terms of when people think of themselves as individuals and when they think of themselves as being part of a larger dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>People also have to recognize that their perception of what's going on is, in fact, very different from the reality of what's going on. For example, an attorney at the EEOC remarked on the fact that the majority of people filing cases of racial discrimination are white. In the vast majority of these cases, they don't win because they mistakenly perceive that they are racially discriminated against when they're not. If you want to enlist the support of white people, you need to get them to realize the position they are in in the first place.<br />\n </p>"},"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"0b5d9d88-1f6f-478c-b931-83f28ab8e394","name":"Structured Advantage: Civil Rights","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"White privilege","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}},{"title":"A Long History of Racial Preferences: For Whites","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>'Colorblind' policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action. But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-coded practices have enabled white Americans.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/ab4690dfbce44c9414a5efd011ceac7e-8fd8740226c51ef8372e0937112a4b0f.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.

The advantages are that it preempts a couple of the major criticisms of affirmative action policy as it now stands. If you make it a class-based system, it becomes less obviously coded with race and therefore less stigmatizing. It also might ensure that these policies get to the people who need it the most; i.e., poor minorities. But if class is interpreted in traditional ways (using parental income or education level), you're going to perpetuate the system as it is now. You must factor in wealth or assets in order to address the real roots of disparity. It is in the area of wealth where the greatest disparities exist by race. Today, a typical white family has eight times the wealth of the typical black family - that statistic is not explainable by income or other factors. So if we were to use class instead of race, I would suggest that it be done based primarily on wealth, and secondarily on income and education level. Then you might have a racially progressive policy that's ostensibly colorblind.

I think the state of racial politics in this country creates for many privileged people a really significant set of personal and political paradoxes. Most people declare their support for the theory of racial equality: rights and privileges, opportunity, fair treatment. And since the civil rights transformations of the 1950s and '60s, many privileged people, especially whites, think that by respecting the letter of civil rights law and by not engaging in obviously offensive acts of discrimination, they are playing by the rules and promoting equality. Here's the paradox, though: since so many of the mechanisms that discriminate, and so many of the mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are not obvious, many people are actually encouraging and perpetuating this inequality - this same inequality that they claim to oppose.
