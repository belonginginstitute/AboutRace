For example, I have a friend who was born in Korea to Korean parents, but as an infant, she was adopted by an Italian family in Italy. Ethnically, she feels Italian: she eats Italian food, she speaks Italian, she knows Italian history and culture. She knows nothing about Korean history and culture. But when she comes to the United States, she's treated racially as Asian.</p>"},"changed":1531976970}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":[{"title":"The idea of race as biology is persistent on America's playing fields, but it is an idea that is not true.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://vimeo.com/newsreeldigital/review/268928749/efc229755c","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f26cce97d96996109da7f5bed5fcc748-ed3056bc1144bb386595c230497645fe.png"}}}},{"title":"At the turn of the 20th century, American society was riding a wave of confidence as an emerging industrial power, and the face of its power and prosperity was white.

I argue that race was institutionalized beginning in the 18th century as a worldview, a set of culturally created attitudes and beliefs about human group differences.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>Slavery and the Coming of Africans</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race and its ideology about human differences arose out of the context of African slavery. But many peoples throughout history have been enslaved without the imposition of racial ideology. When we look at 17th century colonial America before the enactment of laws legitimizing slavery only for Africans and their descendants (after 1660), several facts become clear.</p>\n\n<p>1) The first people that the English tried to enslave and place on plantations were the Irish with whom they had had hostile relations since the 13th century.</p>\n\n<p>2) Some Englishmen had proposed laws enslaving the poor in England and in the colonies to force them to work indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>3) Most of the slaves on English plantations in Barbados and Jamaica were Irish and Indians.</p>\n\n<p>4) Many historians point out that African servants and bonded indentured white servants were treated much the same way. They often joined together, as in the case of Bacon's Rebellion (1676) to oppose the strict and oppressive laws of the colonial government.</p>\n\n<p>In the latter part of the 17th century the demand for labor grew enormously. It had become clear that neither Irishmen nor Indians made good slaves. More than that, the real threats to social order were the poor freed whites who demanded lands and privileges that the upper class colonial governments refused. Some colonial leaders argued that turning to African labor provided a buffer against the masses of poor whites.</p>\n\n<p>Until the 18th century the image of Africans was generally positive. They were farmers and cattle-breeders; they had industries, arts and crafts, governments and commerce. In addition, Africans had immunities to Old World diseases. They were better laborers and they had nowhere to escape to once transplanted to the New World. The colonists themselves came to believe that they could not survive without Africans.</p>\n\n<p>When some Englishmen entered slave trading directly, it became clear that many of the English public had misgivings about slave-trading and re-creating slavery on English soil. It was an era when the ideals of equality, justice, democracy, and human rights were becoming dominant features of Western political philosophy. Those involved in the trade rationalized their actions by arguing that the Africans were heathens after all, and it was a Christian duty to save their souls. By the early part of the 18th century, the institution was fully established for Africans and their descendants. Large numbers of slaves flooded the southern colonies and even some northern ones. Sometimes they outnumbered whites, and the laws governing slavery became increasingly harsher.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A New Social Identity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the image of Africans began to change dramatically. The major catalyst for this transformation was the rise of a powerful antislavery movement that expanded and strengthened during the Revolutionary Era both in Europe and in the United States. As a consequence proslavery forces found it necessary to develop new arguments for defending the institution. Focusing on physical differences, they turned to the notion of the natural inferiority of Africans and thus their God-given suitability for slavery. Such arguments became more frequent and strident from the end of the eighteenth century on, and the characterizations of Africans became more negative.</p>\n\n<p>From here we see the structuring of the ideological components of \"race.\" The term \"race,\" which had been a classificatory term like \"type,\" or \"kind,\" but with ambiguous meaning, became more widely used in the eighteenth century, and crystallized into a distinct reference for Africans, Indians and Europeans. By focusing on the physical and status differences between the conquered and enslaved peoples, and Europeans, the emerging ideology linked the socio-political status and physical traits together and created a new form of social identity. Proslavery leaders among the colonists formulated a new ideology that merged all Europeans together, rich and poor, and fashioned a social system of ranked physically distinct groups. The model for \"race\" and \"races\" was the Great Chain of Being or Scale of Nature (Scala Naturae), a semi-scientific theory of a natural hierarchy of all living things, derived from classical Greek writings. The physical features of different groups became markers or symbols of their status on this scale, and thus justified their positions within the social system. Race ideology proclaimed that the social, spiritual, moral, and intellectual inequality of different groups was, like their physical traits, natural, innate, inherited, and unalterable.</p>\n\n<p>Thus was created the only slave system in the world that became exclusively \"racial.\" By limiting perpetual servitude to Africans and their descendants, colonists were proclaiming that blacks would forever be at the bottom of the social hierarchy. By keeping blacks, Indians and whites socially and spatially separated and enforcing endogamous mating, they were making sure that visible physical differences would be preserved as the premier insignia of unequal social statuses. From its inception separateness and inequality was what \"race\" was all about. The attributes of inferior race status came to be applied to free blacks as well as slaves. In this way, \"race\" was configured as an autonomous new mechanism of social differentiation that transcended the slave condition and persisted as a form of social identity long after slavery ended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Humans as Property</strong></p>\n\n<p>American slavery was unique in another way; that is, how North American slave-owners resolved the age-old dilemma of all slave systems. Slaves are both persons and things--human beings and property. How do you treat a human being as both person and property? And what should take precedence, the human rights of the slave or the property rights of the master? American laws made clear that property was more sacred than people, and the property rights of masters overshadowed the human rights of slaves. Said Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the famous Dred Scott case of 1857, \"Negroes were seen only as property; they were never thought of or spoken of except as property\" and \"(thus) were not intended by the framers of the Constitution to be accorded citizenship rights.\"</p>\n\n<p>In order to transform people solely into property, you must minimize those qualities that make them human. Literature of the early nineteenth century began to portray \"the negro\" as a savage in even stronger terms than those that had been used for the Irish two centuries earlier. This was a major transformation in thought about who Africans were. Historian George Fredrickson states explicitly that \"before 1830 open assertions of permanent black inferiority were exceedingly rare\" (The Black Image in the White Mind, 1987). By mid-century, the ideology of \"negro inferiority\" dominated both popular and scholarly thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Science and the Justification for \"Races\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas. Scholarly writers began attempting to prove scientifically that \"the Negro\" was a different and lower kind of human being. The first published materials arguing from a scientific perspective that \"negroes\" were a separate species from white men appeared in the last decade of the eighteenth century. They argued that Negroes were either a product of degeneration from that first creation, or descendants of a separate creation altogether.</p>\n\n<p>American intellectuals appropriated, and rigidified, the categories of human groups established by European scholars during the eighteenth century, but ignored Blumenbach's caution that human groups blend insensibly into one another, so that it is impossible to place precise boundaries around them.</p>\n\n<p>When Dr. Samuel Morton in the 1830s initiated the field of craniometry, the first school of American anthropology, proponents of race ideology received the most powerful scientific support yet. Measuring the insides of crania collected from many populations, he offered \"evidence\" that the Negro had a smaller brain than whites, with Indians in-between. Morton is also famous for his involvement in a major scientific controversy over creation.</p>\n\n<p>The very existence of a scientific debate over whether blacks and whites were products of a single creation, or of multiple creations, especially in a society dominated by Biblical explanations, seems anomalous. It indicates that the differences between \"races\" had been so magnified and exaggerated that popular consciousness had already widely accepted the idea of blacks being a different and inferior species of humans. Justice Taney's decision reflected this, declaring, \"the negro is a different order of being.\" Thus slave-owners' rights to their \"property\" were upheld in law by appeal to the newly invented identity of peoples from Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists collaborated in confirming popular beliefs, and publications appeared on a regular basis providing the \"proof\" that comforted the white public. That some social leaders were conscious of their role in giving credibility to the invented myths is manifest in statements such as that found in the Charleston Medical Journal after Dr. Morton's death. It states, \"We can only say that we of the South should consider him as our benefactor, for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race\". George Gliddon, co-editor of a famous scientific book Types of Mankind, (1854) which argued that Negroes were closer to apes than to humans and ranked all other groups between whites and Negroes, sent a copy of the book to a famous southern politician, saying that he was sure the south would appreciate the powerful support that this book gave for its \"peculiar institution\" (slavery). Like another famous tome (The Bell Curve, 1995) this was an 800-page book whose first edition sold out immediately; it went through nine other editions before the end of the century. What it said about the inferiority of blacks became widely known, even by those who could not read it.</p>\n\n<p>During discussions in the U.S. Senate on the future of \"the negro\" after slavery, James Henry Hammond proclaimed in 1858 \"somebody has to be the mudsills of society, to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life.\" Negroes were destined to be the mudsills. This was to be their place, one consciously created for them by a society whose cultural values now made it impossible to assimilate them. In the many decades since the Civil War, white society made giant strides to \"keep the negro in his place.\" Public policies and the customs and practices of millions of Americans expressed this racial worldview throughout the twentieth century.</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the circumstances surrounding the origin of the racial worldview in North America. Race ideology was a mechanism justifying what had already been established as unequal social groups; it was from its inception, and is today, about who should have access to privilege, power, status, and wealth, and who should not. As a useful political ideology for conquerors, it spread into colonial situations around the world. It was promulgated in the latter half of the 19th century by some Europeans against other Europeans and reached its most extreme development in the twentieth century Nazi holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>All anthropologists should understand that \"race\" has no intrinsic relationship to human biological diversity, that such diversity is a natural product of primarily evolutionary forces while \"race\" is a social invention.</p>"}},{"id":"44758e6d-113e-4ba8-8728-a13be9cb9bb2","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>'Colorblind' policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action. But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-coded practices have enabled white Americans.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2004, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Larry Adelman is Series Executive Producer of RACE - The Power of an Illusion and co-director of California Newsreel.</p>"},"field_copyright":{"processed":"<p>©2003 California Newsreel.

After all, it's been nearly 40 years now since the Civil Rights Act was passed.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>What we don't readily acknowledge is that racial preferences have a long, institutional history in this country - a white history. Here are a few ways in which government programs and practices have channeled wealth and opportunities to white people at the expense of others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early Racial Preferences</strong></p>\n\n<p>We all know the old history, but it's still worth reminding ourselves of its scale and scope. Affirmative action in the American \"workplace\" first began in the late 17th century when European indentured servants - the original source of unfree labor on the new tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland - were replaced by African slaves. In exchange for their support and their policing of the growing slave population, lower-class Europeans won new rights, entitlements, and opportunities from the planter elite.</p>\n\n<p>White Americans were also given a head start with the help of the U.S. Army. The 1830 Indian Removal Act, for example, forcibly relocated Cherokee, Creeks and other eastern Indians to west of the Mississippi River to make room for white settlers. The 1862 Homestead Act followed suit, giving away millions of acres - for free - of what had been Indian Territory west of the Mississippi. Ultimately, 270 million acres, or 10% of the total land area of the United States, was converted to private hands, overwhelmingly white, under Homestead Act provisions.</p>\n\n<p>The 1790 Naturalization Act permitted only \"free white persons\" to become naturalized citizens, thus opening the doors to European immigrants but not others. Only citizens could vote, serve on juries, hold office, and in some cases, even hold property. In this century, Alien Land Laws passed in California and other states, reserved farm land for white growers by preventing Asian immigrants, ineligible to become citizens, from owning or leasing land. Immigration restrictions further limited opportunities for non-white groups. Racial barriers to naturalized U.S. citizenship weren't removed until the McCarran-Walter Act in 1952, and white racial preferences in immigration remained until 1965.</p>\n\n<p>In the South, the federal government never followed through on General Sherman's Civil War plan to divide up plantations and give each freed slave \"40 acres and a mule\" as reparations. Only once was monetary compensation made for slavery, in Washington, D.C. There, government officials paid up to $300 per slave upon emancipation - not to the slaves, but to local slaveholders as compensation for loss of property.</p>\n\n<p>When slavery ended, its legacy lived on not only in the impoverished condition of Black people but in the wealth and prosperity that accrued to white slave owners and their descendants. Economists who try to place a dollar value on how much white Americans have profited from 200 years of unpaid slave labor, including interest, begin their estimates at $1 trillion.</p>\n\n<p>Jim Crow laws, instituted in the late 19th and early 20th century and not overturned in many states until the 1960s, reserved the best jobs, neighborhoods, schools and hospitals for white people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Advantages Grow, Generation to Generation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Less known are more recent government racial preferences, first enacted during the New Deal, that directed wealth to white families and continue to shape life opportunities and chances today.</p>\n\n<p>The landmark Social Security Act of 1935 provided a safety net for millions of workers, guaranteeing them an income after retirement. But the act specifically excluded two occupations: agricultural workers and domestic servants, who were predominately African American, Mexican, and Asian. As low-income workers, they also had the least opportunity to save for their retirement. They couldn't pass wealth on to their children. Just the opposite. Their children had to support them.</p>\n\n<p>Like Social Security, the 1935 Wagner Act helped establish an important new right for white people. By granting unions the power of collective bargaining, it helped millions of white workers gain entry into the middle class over the next 30 years. But the Wagner Act permitted unions to exclude non-whites and deny them access to better paid jobs and union protections and benefits such as health care, job security, and pensions. Many craft unions remained nearly all-white well into the 1970s. In 1972, for example, every single one of the 3,000 members of Los Angeles Steam Fitters Local #250 was still white.</p>\n\n<p>But it was another racialized New Deal program, the Federal Housing Administration, that helped generate much of the wealth that so many white families enjoy today. These revolutionary programs made it possible for millions of average white Americans - but not others - to own a home for the first time. The government set up a national neighborhood appraisal system, explicitly tying mortgage eligibility to race. Integrated communities were ipso facto deemed a financial risk and made ineligible for home loans, a policy known today as \"redlining.\" Between 1934 and 1962, the federal government backed $120 billion of home loans. More than 98% went to whites. Of the 350,000 new homes built with federal support in northern California between 1946 and 1960, fewer than 100 went to African Americans.</p>\n\n<p>These government programs made possible the new segregated white suburbs that sprang up around the country after World War II. Government subsidies for municipal services helped develop and enhance these suburbs further, in turn fueling commercial investments. Freeways tied the new suburbs to central business districts, but they often cut through and destroyed the vitality of non-white neighborhoods in the central city.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Black and Latino mortgage applicants are still 60% more likely than whites to be turned down for a loan, even after controlling for employment, financial, and neighborhood factors. According to the Census, whites are more likely to be segregated than any other group. As recently as 1993, 86% of suburban whites still lived in neighborhoods with a black population of less than 1%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reaping the Rewards of Racial Preference</strong></p>\n\n<p>One result of the generations of preferential treatment for whites is that a typical white family today has on average eight times the assets, or net worth, of a typical African American family, according to New York University economist Edward Wolff. Even when families of the same income are compared, white families have more than twice the wealth of Black families. Much of that wealth difference can be attributed to the value of one's home, and how much one inherited from parents.</p>\n\n<p>But a family's net worth is not simply the finish line, it's also the starting point for the next generation. Those with wealth pass their assets on to their children - by financing a college education, lending a hand during hard times, or assisting with the down payment for a home. Some economists estimate that up to 80 percent of lifetime wealth accumulation depends on these intergenerational transfers. White advantage is passed down, from parent to child to grandchild. As a result, the racial wealth gap - and the head start enjoyed by whites - appears to have grown since the civil rights days.</p>\n\n<p>In 1865, just after Emancipation, it is not surprising that African Americans owned only 0.5 percent of the total worth of the United States. But by 1990, a full 135 years after the abolition of slavery, Black Americans still possessed only a meager 1 percent of national wealth. As legal scholar john powell says in the documentary series Race - The Power of an Illusion, \"The slick thing about whiteness is that whites are getting the spoils of a racist system even if they are not personally racist.\"</p>\n\n<p>But rather than recognize how \"racial preferences\" have tilted the playing field and given us a head start in life, many whites continue to believe that race does not affect our lives. Instead, we chastise others for not achieving what we have; we even invert the situation and accuse non-whites of using \"the race card\" to advance themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Or we suggest that differential outcomes may simply result from differences in \"natural\" ability or motivation. However, sociologist Dalton Conley's research shows that when we compare the performance of families across racial lines who make not just the same income, but also hold similar net worth, a very interesting thing happens: many of the racial disparities in education, graduation rates, welfare usage and other outcomes disappear. The \"performance gap\" between whites and nonwhites is a product not of nature, but unequal circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>\"Colorblind\" policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action. But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-coded practices have enabled white Americans to long accumulate.</p>\n\n<p>Isn't it a little late in the game to suddenly decide that race shouldn't matter?</p>"}},{"id":"b41b7caa-c308-43df-9570-f18460475682","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>With the hardening of slavery came the emergence of race.

So the Bible can also be, and has been, a weapon for liberation and equality, and I think it can continue to be that.</p>"},"changed":1531506386}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}}],"field_author_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4b8fc43d1babfef5a377b1c766be8a46-10829109d27917328f1d83016d74fc05.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"b2dac59f-15ba-5896-bd66-162c64822ecb >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":480,"height":600,"src":"/static/4b8fc43d1babfef5a377b1c766be8a46-10829109d27917328f1d83016d74fc05.jpg"},"sizes":{"src":"/static/4b8fc43d1babfef5a377b1c766be8a46-10829109d27917328f1d83016d74fc05-c200c.jpg"},"resolutions":{"height":500,"width":400,"src":"/static/4b8fc43d1babfef5a377b1c766be8a46-10829109d27917328f1d83016d74fc05-10d9a.jpg"}}}},"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/7a02b2ce7613d7e7feda9b6125486fd1-b9898519a84bb349021f570e13b6451e.png","childImageSharp":{"id":"930105d1-e2e5-5cb5-84ab-360d620d9c8f >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1183,"height":783,"src":"/static/7a02b2ce7613d7e7feda9b6125486fd1-b9898519a84bb349021f570e13b6451e.png"},"sizes":{"src":"/static/7a02b2ce7613d7e7feda9b6125486fd1-b9898519a84bb349021f570e13b6451e-2fd78.png"},"resolutions":{"height":265,"width":400,"src":"/static/7a02b2ce7613d7e7feda9b6125486fd1-b9898519a84bb349021f570e13b6451e-37095.png"}}}}},"field_large_callout_text":{"processed":"<p>Was it inevitable that Africans would be imported to the Americas to become slaves? Did European views about racial inferiority contribute to the fact of New World African slavery?</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>Although today we might think that racial attitudes have always existed, and that they influenced or contributed to the emergence of the transatlantic African slave trade, the reverse is, in fact, true. Modern ideas about race, racial difference and inferiority emerged to explain the societies that arose in the New World as a result of slavery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Different Colonies, Different Societies</strong></p>\n\n<p>The earliest European colonizers of the Americas, the Spanish, did not develop significant slave societies in its colonies. Columbus tried to grow sugar for profit, forcing indigenous people on the island of Hispaniola to work his fields, but his efforts were unsuccessful. Cortés and Pizarro's conquest of the Aztec and Incan empires in the early 16th century, however, gave the Spanish an alternative source of wealth. The Spanish assumed control of these large Central and South American empires' systems for tribute. Using existing arrangements for indigenous corvée labor, they extracted gold and silver from established mines, filling the coffers of a quickly emerging global Spanish empire and providing specie and currency for its trade and economy.</p>\n\n<p>The Europeans who followed found no similar natural wealth in the regions they settled - the Portuguese in Brazil, then later, the Dutch, French and British on the coasts (including what is now Louisiana) and in the islands of the Caribbean. Instead, continuing Columbus' lead, they tried to establish colonies to produce agricultural goods to sell and trade, again using indigenous peoples as a workforce. These attempts failed because natives were not familiar with European farming methods and because they escaped and fled into territories they knew well. Portuguese outposts on the western coast of Africa, established as way stations for their fleets to travel into the Indian Ocean and further east, provided an alternative supply of labor. African slaves - initially captured in intertribal warfare but later directly for sale in what became a lucrative slave trade - were sold and shipped to the Americas to be the workforce for European colonial enterprises. This African enslavement was driven, not out of a sense of racial inferiority, but to satisfy labor needs. Although initially not profitable, the value of the African slaves themselves as well as the emergence of new European tastes - and a market - for American-produced luxuries such as chocolate and tobacco, eventually resulted in an enormous and profitable system of trans-Atlantic trade. European ships carried supplies to African slave ports. From there, cargoes of recently captured slaves were shipped to the Americas from Africa, where those who survived the horrific journey were sold as chattel. Plantations, part of a new form and system of agricultural production, purchased these slaves in large numbers to work fields that grew rice, indigo, cacao, tobacco, and sugar for the return trade back to Europe. Slaves became such a large part of the population and their work such a large part of the economy in these colonies that historians now call them as \"slave societies.\" \"Race,\" as it developed in these colonial slave societies was different from how it developed in the United States.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Colonial America</strong></p>\n\n<p>The situation was different in the British colonies that became the United States. The New England colonies were established as places for followers of Protestant dissenters to live and practice their religious faith. The Chesapeake colonies, Virginia and Maryland, established in the early 17th century, and later the Carolinas, were settlement colonies where land was initially given to colonists in exchange for their efforts to cultivate and work it. Those colonists who fared well in the harsh conditions could accumulate enough land to require additional labor to work their holdings. After unsuccessful attempts to use native groups as workers, wealthy colonists imported indentured servants from Britain - an available supply of workers because of population growth. In the first century of Virginia's existence, 100,000 of the 130,000 British arrivals to the colony were indentures. Beginning in the 1620s, colonists also began to import slaves, although most were from the Americas and not directly from Africa. While slaves were present in these British colonies, the larger presence of European settlers and servants meant that their societies and economies were mixed, or what historians, \"societies with slaves.\"</p>\n\n<p>Although it was permanent servitude, slavery in the 17th century Chesapeake was not like slavery as it later developed and in some ways, was difficult to distinguish from indentured servitude. In an era where few laws defined slavery, slaves enjoyed limited rights including the ability to work land for themselves, to own property, including other slaves, and to marry. Children of slaves did not inherit their parents' bondage. Although it was not generally the case, slaves could earn or save enough money to purchase their own freedom. While indentured servants worked under temporary, as opposed to permanent, terms of service, the life expectancy in the early decades of the Chesapeake colonies was so low that almost two-thirds did not survive to the end of their contracts. Indentured servants often worked with slaves under the same conditions - one reason why there was occasional intermarriage between the two groups, European and African.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Did Race Develop in This Context?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The harsh conditions and low life expectancy of colonists in Virginia eventually changed as settlers became more familiar with its climate and their environment. Increased survival and a continued influx of colonists brought population growth and an increasing demand for land, which became more scarce and further removed from access to roads and water transportation, both vital for agricultural commerce. Landholdings in Virginia expanded from the Tidewater region of fertile lands and easily navigable rivers into the less fertile lands of the Piedmont foothills and beyond, where they collided with the territorial interests of native groups. An emerging planter class of colonists who had succeeded in accumulating land and money shared few and fewer interests with newly arrived immigrants, more and more of them indentured workers who survived long enough to want to claim land for themselves, and many of whom continued to share interests and concerns with African slaves and freedmen.</p>\n\n<p>The volatility of the tensions grew as the colony grew and decades passed, exploding in 1676 in what became known as Bacon's Rebellion. Initially a conflict between William Berkeley, the governor of Virginia, and Nathaniel Bacon, a wealthy settler in the Virginia upcountry, over land and Indian relations in the western part of the colony, the rebellion sparked concerns about class and race when Bacon went east to Jamestown, the colonial capital. Arrested, then pardoned by Berkeley, Bacon returned with a small army and promised to grant freedom to slaves and indentured servants who rallied to his cause - as did Berkeley, less successfully. His followers seized and set fire to Jamestown and temporarily gained control of the colony. The rebellion itself proved short-lived when Bacon died suddenly a month later and many of his followers were executed, but its larger implications remained. Beyond Bacon's specific issues, the coalition between poor whites and African slaves and freedmen in his rebellion produced a larger concern that such a coalition might remain a continuing source of further revolts and class uprisings.</p>\n\n<p>Such concerns, however, were mitigated by intervening circumstances. In the years following Bacon's Rebellion, the distinction between indentured servitude and slavery grew into a pronounced difference. Indenture became less attractive as a source of labor because servants now lived long enough to claim land - as the rebellion had demonstrated violently - and improved economic conditions in Britain reduced the supply of workers willing to come to America and increased the price of their contracts. Africans continued to be readily available, and because many were not Christian, they could be enslaved and regulated in a manner that indentures could not. Virginia enacted a series of laws, constituting a formal slave code that removed many of the rights slaves had previously enjoyed and added further restrictions to slavery including anti-miscegenation statutes. Previously one of several labor sources, slaves became Virginia's primary workforce for its plantations, and slavery an integral institution within its society.</p>\n\n<p>With the hardening of slavery came the emergence of race. Previously, people's appearance and origins had not mattered as much before socially, particularly among the working class. The physical distinctiveness of African slaves - now absent similar European indentured servants - however, not only marked their newly created subordinate position within Virginian society, it became the justification and reason for that position. Virginia's example, in turn, became a model that other British colonies with slaves, when they were created, followed with a mutually reinforcing dynamic. \"Race\" explained why Africans were slaves, while slavery's degradation supplied the evidence for their inferiority. When Thomas Jefferson observed almost a century later that Africans were slaves, the apparent naturalness of their position had erased the actual social history that had produced it.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"title":"Victoria Robinson shares how she uses her favorite clip on redlining in her teaching","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/280782466","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4580576fe9e74f76d3dae0589b93547e-ef1f6d2046a823c9596262bed16a9fda.png"}}}}],"interviews":[{"title":"Interview with Karen Ordahl Kupperman","changed":1528242883,"field_interviewee_bio":{"processed":"Karen Ordahl Kupperman is a professor of history at New York University.
