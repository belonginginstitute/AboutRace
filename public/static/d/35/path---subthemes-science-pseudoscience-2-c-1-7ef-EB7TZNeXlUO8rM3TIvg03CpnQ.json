Let's pull them out! But first, they must realize they are in a pit so that they will extend a hand.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>Falling into the race pit is easy to do. Racial terms are frequently used and are very familiar. To paraphrase Henry Louis Gates, we see and are seen as race. Race is a trope, a floating signifier. Race is lived experience and a sociopolitical construct. It is not biology.</p>\n\n<p>Falling into the race pit starts with thinking that race is a biological and scientific concept. It is as easy as unreflectively using racial terms to describe a skull. The racial terms than take on power when they connect to imbued meanings.</p>\n\n<p>It takes vigilance to avoid falling into the race pit; and it takes a thoughtful and scientific effort to get to deeper meaning. The race pit is most harmful because it is a place from which one cannot advance to understand human variation. Medical proclamations made without a biological basis result in a great deal of unseen harm. And, in some cases, scientific statements feed political abuse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Silent Violence and Racism</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is hardly radical to suggest that there are connections - sometimes subtle and indirect through words, ideas, programs and actions - between soft uses of race in everyday science and blatant racism. Falsely maintaining that race is real biologically leaves the door open to misuse. It is an easy step from the misuse of race in studies of skull shape or hemoglobin levels to its misuse in studies of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>We have also seen many times the leap from the misuse of race in science to its misuse in public policy. Bad science always makes bad policy. But educating that biological differences between groups are not deep, hereditary and fixed eliminates a major weapon in the racists' arsenal. It exposes racism as the human social evil that it is.</p>\n\n<p>Kennewick Man continues to be a clear example of not just what is wrong scientifically with race, but also of the potential misuse by racists. James Chatters suggests that he did not intend to racialize Kennewick Man (February 1998 AN, p. 19). But it was not just I who saw race in racial words. Jonathan Mozzochi, research director of the Coalition for Human Dignity, has been following reports of Kennewick Man in the right-wing press. He shows that the Asatru Folk Assembly, partners with anthropologists on the legal suit to allow study of Kennewick Man, is not a harmless bunch of spiritualist crazies. Their leaders have extensive neo-Nazi connections. Additionally, Louis Beam, a former Texas Klansman and \"ambassador at large\" for the Aryan Nations, has written numerous articles in such rags as The Spotlight, a large circulation, anti-Semitic weekly, in which he uses the identification of Kennewick Man as a \"Caucasoid\" to support the view that the Americas were first settled by whites (\"Races and Relics,\" The Dignity Report, 1998, 5, p. 4). Aren't scientists responsible for speaking out against unintended interpretations of their words and ideas?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Back to Basics</strong></p>\n\n<p>To judge from the discussions at the 1997 AAA presidential panel on race, it is now widely accepted in anthropology that race is a biological myth but that racial discrimination and racism are all too real (C Mukhopadhyay, March 1998, AN, p. 28). This consensus, however, does not yet include many physical anthropologists. Fundamental errors are voiced in recent letters and commentaries in the AN submitted by skeletal biologists who, with other physical anthropologists, lay claim to scientific authority and are key to articulating anthropological perspectives on human diversity. The first error is that the idea of race is confused with the reality of human biological variation. A second error occurs when race as biology is confused with race as sociocultural construct. It's time to go back to basics.</p>\n\n<p>It has been known for decades that racial typology fails to explain human variation, that is, our species does not fit into a small number of fixed, ideal types. We know, for example, that:</p>\n\n<p>Human variation is generally continuous, with no clear points of demarcation. (It is impossible to reliably say where one race ends and another begins. Groups living close to each other tend to be biologically alike, and so race has an appearance of reality, but this is only geographic similarity.)</p>\n\n<p>Human variation is highly nonconcordant. One trait infrequently predicts for another. (One can not read deeper meanings into physical cues.)</p>\n\n<p>There is greater variation within than among purported races. (Knowing an individual's purported race tells us little about the individual.)<br />\nAlthough there is no disagreement with these points, about half of all physical anthropologists continue to think race is a salient concept and many teach and do research on human variation from a racial approach. They continue to use race because they think that race shifted from a typological to a population concept starting with Carleton Coon's work after World War II. Gill writes that Ashley Montagu and his followers failed to notice (1990).</p>\n\n<p>But as much as my colleagues might want to see racial analysis as having made a paradigm shift from a typological to population concept, this is not possible because races are not populations, and adaptation and evolution work locally rather than at the abstracted level of races. In common usage, scientists, students and the public reduce human variation to 3 or 4 types, just as they did a century ago. Color lines shift, but the underlying concept, contra Gill, endures. Montagu did notice; he just did not buy it. As J. Buettner-Janusch remarked in his review of Coon's The Living Races of Race (1965), \"Typology, typology, typology, nothing by typology\" (American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 1966, p. 187).</p>\n\n<p>George Armelagos has characterized the race concept as a chameleon, which changed its color, but not its reality as a folk concept, to survive the Darwinian revolution, the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and the new physical anthropology of more recent years. Compare this with the common refrain that those who deny race are simply trying to be \"politically correct.\" Gill writes that \"they have their hearts, but not their heads in the right place.\" (Gill and S. Rhine, Skeletal Attribution of Race, 1990, p. viii). What is so \"heady\" about a concept that cannot be explained or defined?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Classification Wrongs</strong></p>\n\n<p>In addition to convincing themselves that race is an evolutionary concept, there is an additional reason why anthropologists still use the concept: race is convenient. By analogy, classifying hats by size allows us to pick those most likely to fit. The classification may not be perfect, but it is a useful start. Gill suggests that racial classification is no different than classification by sex, age or height (March 1998 AN, p. 1). The analogy, however, falls on its nasal spine.</p>\n\n<p>When a hatter sizes a hat, she knows what she is measuring and her work can be repeated. Classifications by sex, age or height might not be perfect, but the criteria are sensible, they fit the problem and they are agreed upon. Conversely, because race is socially defined, it is first like classifying by a concept such as \"beauty,\" with no way to compare standards of beauty across classifiers and then having others decide to classify by \"purity.\" The problem is that there is no objective and repeatable standard of classification. As a result, use of race in biomedicine, where repeatability is monumentally important, courts disaster.</p>\n\n<p>It gets worse. The unexamined movement from social definition of race to biology leads to conflation of nature and lived experience. This clouds whether observed racial differences in athletic performance, birth weight or IQ are due to lived experience, genes, or a tangled gene-environment combination.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when genes come into play, the assumption is that a racial analysis might substitute for a more detailed individual genetic analysis. Separate U.S. black and white standards for diagnosis of anemia have been constructed because it was found that blacks have lower mean hemoglobin concentrations (the basis of diagnosis of anemia) than whites. It was thus suggested in the 1970s that the standard for diagnoses of anemia in blacks should match this inherited, pan-racial characteristic. The consequence of lowering the black standard halves the number of black women diagnosed as anemic and probably too the percent treated.</p>\n\n<p>Robert and Fatimah Jackson have demonstrated two grand leaps of scientific faith in constructing race specific standards (Ethnicity and Disease, 1991, p. 1). First, hemoglobin differences between blacks and whites are almost entirely explained by environmental factors (conflation of nature and lived experience). Second, there is no basis to assume that a genetic difference is pan African American (conflation of genes and race). Race as biology is not just wrong, it is harmful.</p>\n\n<p>James Chatters apologizes for using the term \"Caucasoid\" to describe Kennewick Man's biology and then excuses himself by saying no other words would do. But there are many precise terms that are nonracial. For example, Chatters could have described Kennewick Man as having a large nasal spine. Because this trait is frequently seen in some contemporary groups, its presence in Kennewick Man might suggest a biological relationship. This is different, however, from proclaiming that Kennewick Man is a member of a group that only exists in an individual's mind.</p>\n\n<p>If Frank Livingstone (U. Michigan) had continued to think of it as a racial disease (rather than as clinally distributed), he likely would not have so clearly seen the relationship between sickle cell anemia and the spread of malaria. Race science is bad science because it inhibits deeper understanding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From Biology to Lived Experience</strong></p>\n\n<p>Human biological variability is real. But race is a biological sham: it is theoretically passé, does not fit the facts, holds back science and causes harm. A common sleight of hand of the political right is to conflate the myth of biological race with the cultural experience of race, e.g., \"If race is a (biological) myth, let's get rid of affirmative action.\" But the truth is just the opposite. Showing that race is a biological myth leads us to clarify the sociopolitical salience of race and racism. Race as biology does not explain the persistent and shameful rate at which black babies suffer low birth weight and infant mortality. It doesn't explain why the death rate from breast cancer recently fell for all women but did not budge for black women, who already had a higher rate of death. Nor does race as biology explain why black male life expectancy in Harlem is less than the life expectancy of men in Bangladesh. But the suffering is still there.</p>\n\n<p>There is no halfway between seeing race as biologically valid or not. Any reformation of race as biology will simply be interpreted as race in the older typological paradigm. What do we lose by giving up race as a biological concept? We lost some instant recognition of what we do. It takes a bit longer to explain human variation.</p>\n\n<p>What do we gain by sending race to the dust heap of history? The possibilities are awesome. We could develop a new and exciting biocultural paradigm. More important still, we would literally save lives.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"83c462b0-415d-4a37-b8c7-3820ee30d137","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>End racist practices, end economic exploitation, and everybody's health improves.

The crusty trope that race is a social artifact crumbles in the face of the bright new genomics, he asserts. Genetic variation may be greater within groups than between groups, as Richard Lewontin pointed out back in the dark ages of the 1970s, but only for single genes. Taken together, across genetic loci allelic distributions correlate into clusters long recognized as the five races: European, East Asian, African, Amerindian, and Australasian. So suck it up, constructionists, race is biologically intrinsic.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>Moreover, get out of the way. The recognition that race is inherently biological, Leroi writes, can improve medical care, \"as different races are prone to different diseases.\" African Americans, for example, suffer greater prevalences of heart disease and prostate cancer. Even if such differences arise from socioeconomic causes, Leroi argues, we should--ignoring the man behind the curtain--embrace geneticists' very important mission, \"searching for racial differences in the frequencies of genetic variants that cause diseases.\"</p>\n\n<p>And yet much of Leroi's article unravels his own argument. Leroi takes population geneticists to task for caving into political correctness by investigating \"ethnic groups,\" a euphemism that conflates human differences across scale. Never mind that population geneticists prefer the term less out of deference to present sensibilities than to the data themselves. Work by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza's group (Cavalli-Sforza 2001, Underhill 2003), among others, show human history--back to our species' origins--to be marked by layers of migration sweeping back and forth across the continents, gurgling here and there into local pools of idiosyncratic admixture. While the resulting genetic frequencies do not embody a homogenous mush, neither does a stark black and white favored by the new racialists result. Instead, genetic maps are marked by fine-scaled and functionally important population gradients.</p>\n\n<p>Leroi recognizes these complications, but still asks us to ignore them in favor of, ironically enough, a social construct. Just as it is difficult to talk of the world's physical topography in terms of multiple contour lines and elevations and easier to do so in general terms, such as grouping a variety of tall peaks as \"mountain ranges,\" \"so, too, it is with the genetic topography of our species.\" Grouping the billion people of European descent together as a race is easier, \"a shorthand that enables us to speak sensibly...about genetic rather than cultural or political differences.\" So, it would appear that bleaching out complications when discussing human variation makes life easier. Of course, as those dastardly social constructionists are apt to ask, easier for whom?</p>\n\n<p>For one, according to Leroi, the pharmaceutical companies. As race can affect medical treatment, \"many new drugs are now labeled with warnings that they may not work in some ethnic or racial groups.\" That such effects need not be predominantly biological in origin apparently matters little. Leroi admits differences among races arise from population averages alone. But as we are unlikely to have individuals' genomes sequenced any time soon, and presumably won't be able to individualize medical treatment that way, we'll just have to accept a racialized medical genetics. Nothing like an argument of expediency to convince a crowd. The pharmaceutical companies are doing it, so get with it, baby!</p>\n\n<p>Here, Leroi, an evolutionary developmental biologist, bumbles back into the typology the Darwinian revolution revoked. As Ernst Mayr (1976, 2004) explained, until the early 19th century biologists classified species in essentialist terms. A specific type or specimen defined a species and any variation from the type was considered deviant or unreal. In statistical terms, a centroid measure such as the mean phenotype defined the species, while the variance was thought noise. Typological definitions accounted for the differences among species and, without variation, explained the impossibility of evolution.</p>\n\n<p>Darwin and his colleagues turned biology on its head. The population thinking they introduced emphasized the variation in populations. As natural history studies accumulated, it became apparent individual organisms varied in just about any and all characteristics, both across and within species. Individuals even changed over the course of their lifespans. Here, averages became thought of as constructs and the variances the reality. Variation's reality proved fundamental to Darwin's natural selection. The greater the variation in the population, the faster natural selection works and adaptations arise.</p>\n\n<p>Mayr declared the distinction between the two kinds of thinking about populations couldn't be overemphasized. He noted its social consequences. Essentialisms form the core of all racialist theories of human populations, in which all members of a race are thought exhibiting characteristics of the race type. Even as population biologists use differences in averages to heuristically distinguish populations--human or otherwise--by race or subspecies, individuals clearly vary in all traits and can be reaggregated from trait to trait.</p>\n\n<p>Leroi and the new racialists are trying to get around population thinking by correlating aggregations across loci, as a set of emergent essentialisms. Funny, though, that within the very medical framework they are attempting to define, as they live by the sword of correlation, so must they die by that sword. When we correlate putative racial continua across diseases, the same groups are time and again imputed the most susceptible alleles. African Americans suffer not only greater prevalence of and/or lesser survivorship from heart disease (Andrews et al. 2001) and prostate cancer (Reddy et al. 2003), as Leroi notes, but the same for kidney cancer (Vaishampayan et al. 2003), breast cancer (Ghafoor et al. 2003), cervical cancer (Jemal et al. 2004), oral cancers (Shavers et al. 2003), lung cancer (Stellman et al. 2003), colorectal cancer (Baquet and Commiskey 1999), pancreatic cancer (Silverman et al. 2003), endometrical cancer (Randall and Armstrong 2003), lymphomas (Briggs et al. 2003), tooth loss (Gilbert et al. 2003), obesity and diabetes (Cossrow and Faulkner 2004), chronic asthma (Boudreaux et al. 2003), Lupus nephritis (Lea 2002), HIV (Torian et al. 2002), hepatitis B and syphilis (Schrag et al. 2003), gonorrhea (Dombrowski et al. 2004), arthritis (Dunlop et al. 2001), stroke (Ruland and Gorelick 2005), and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Are we to assume that African Americans and other minority groups carry the most susceptible alleles for every one of these diseases? Can we pretend that the vagaries of mutational chance just happened to deal African Americans the greatest susceptibilities for every ailment on our awful list? While there are indeed well-documented examples of illness with important genetic roots, for a framework addressing health disparities we'd exert greater impact by placing our attention back on the man behind the curtain. Racism and other sources of population-level stress have, by way of their emotional and material deprivations, definitional effect on individuals as early as conception, as well as on the populations of which they are a part. Racism shapes ontogeny, regardless of allelic frequencies. And it's to that relationship and its overdetermination of the correlation of diseases where research and social action need to be directed.</p>\n\n<p>For most geneticists, then, there appear two unpleasant paths. One involves accepting population disparities in health outcomes are largely driven by social constructs such as racism, rendering genetics' role ancillary. A second path, the one Leroi has taken, means pushing back and declaring race genetic. Given the country's political economy this second one may indeed be the road many will choose, a choice for which it is fast becoming apparent they will be greatly rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>There may be a third path. Biologists and social scientists can work together under the umbrella of history. Health outcomes emerge out of layers of historical processes--some ancient, others more immediate. While it may jump to mind that evolutionary processes are the ancient ones, evolution generates novelty daily, as HIV quasispecies show. Human social processes, on the other hand, have been operating in one form or another since the origin of the species, even as they have undergone fundamental changes across history. So there are likely interactions occurring across scales of biocultural organization worth study by researchers of a variety of disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>In that context social scientists can comfortably assimilate the idea that genes exist and may have effect on an individual's pathologies. Biologists, in turn, should come to terms with public health data that clearly indicate the means by which to incur the greatest impact on population health involve altering social circumstances, with dividends for all. End racist practices, end economic exploitation, and everybody's health improves. For the benefit of those who don't believe it we should run the experiment for a few generations and see what results.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"17138c46-4520-41ea-b5ac-53bd0629f2f7","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>It is difficult to bring anti-discrimination to the market, and as time goes by, it is harder and harder to bring it to the government's attention.

Drug metabolism can be influenced by the rate at which drugs are transported into cells, the rate at which they are broken down inside of cells, the rate at which they are excreted, etcetera. Genes influence these processes because these processes are conducted by enzymes and transport proteins. However, environmental factors also play a strong role. Diet, for instance, may increase the production of a relevant enzyme. It may provide co-factors that allow the enzyme to act more efficiently or it may inhibit an enzyme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some drugs or classes of drugs, studies have shown differences in the statistical mean drug response between study subjects from different races. For instance, one review article reported that there is a statistically significant difference between white people (of some nationality) and Chinese people (one nationality of Asian people) in the amount of the anticoagulant warfarin needed to maintain a therapeutic dose. The average dose for Chinese people was 50% less than the average dose for white people. Yet, these data directly contradict what the genetic data predict. We know of at least one gene that has a significant effect on warfarin metabolism, and we know which versions of the gene produce efficient warfarin metabolism in the test tube. If we only looked at genetics, we would think that white people would need, on average, less of the drug to obtain a therapeutic dose. (Xie, et al., \"Molecular Basis of Ethnic Differences in Drug Disposition and Response,\" Annual Rev. Pharmacol and Toxicol. 2001. 51:815-50.) Furthermore, studies have shown that Japanese people (a nationality of Asian people) in Japan require a lower dose of warfarin than Japanese people in the US to achieve a therapeutic dose. (Id. p.818)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This example highlights the important point that when we see racial differences in some medical outcome, we should not assume that the differences are genetic. This example also reminds us how difficult it is to make categorical claims about drug metabolism and people of any particular race and ethnicity. In any given study, the answers you get may depend on which white people or which Asian people or which black people you are studying.

Drug metabolism can be influenced by the rate at which drugs are transported into cells, the rate at which they are broken down inside of cells, the rate at which they are excreted, etcetera. Genes influence these processes because these processes are conducted by enzymes and transport proteins. However, environmental factors also play a strong role. Diet, for instance, may increase the production of a relevant enzyme. It may provide co-factors that allow the enzyme to act more efficiently or it may inhibit an enzyme.</p>\n\n<p>For some drugs or classes of drugs, studies have shown differences in the statistical mean drug response between study subjects from different races. For instance, one review article reported that there is a statistically significant difference between white people (of some nationality) and Chinese people (one nationality of Asian people) in the amount of the anticoagulant warfarin needed to maintain a therapeutic dose. The average dose for Chinese people was 50% less than the average dose for white people. Yet, these data directly contradict what the genetic data predict. We know of at least one gene that has a significant effect on warfarin metabolism, and we know which versions of the gene produce efficient warfarin metabolism in the test tube. If we only looked at genetics, we would think that white people would need, on average, less of the drug to obtain a therapeutic dose. (Xie, et al., \"Molecular Basis of Ethnic Differences in Drug Disposition and Response,\" Annual Rev. Pharmacol and Toxicol. 2001. 51:815-50.) Furthermore, studies have shown that Japanese people (a nationality of Asian people) in Japan require a lower dose of warfarin than Japanese people in the US to achieve a therapeutic dose. (Id. p.818)</p>\n\n<p>This example highlights the important point that when we see racial differences in some medical outcome, we should not assume that the differences are genetic. This example also reminds us how difficult it is to make categorical claims about drug metabolism and people of any particular race and ethnicity.

Of the 314 African Americans in the sample, a total of 13 had HIV infections, including four women who received placebos. News media around the country picked up the spontaneously revised VaxGen message and broadcast loudly that blacks had a \"78 percent protection\" from this vaccine. Even more problematic, four Asian Americans were infected, a few more were not -- and there was a suggestion that the vaccine might work on people of color.</p>\n\n<p>As any statistician will testify, the number of African Americans and Asians is so small that one can have no confidence in these \"findings.\" But that is precisely where the story starts to get interesting. To understand why, it is necessary to place the VaxGen story in the wider context of a controversy that is stirring deep and strong divisions in the fields of pharmacogenomics, epidemiology and pharmacotoxicology -- the appropriate role, if any, of race, in the effective delivery of drugs and vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>This controversy will surely hit the headlines before the end of year, because in late fall we will learn the fate of a drug designed to be marketed specifically for blacks with heart disease. In what has been touted as \"the first ethnic drug,\" the biotech firm NitroMed received a green light from the Food and Drug Administration in March 2001 to proceed with a full-scale clinical trial, \"the first prospective trial conducted exclusively in black men and women suffering from heart failure.\" The drug is BiDil, and the study has been endorsed by the Association of Black Cardiologists. </p>\n\n<p>The BiDil story has some fascinating parallels with the VaxGen story. BiDil is a drug designed to restore low or depleted nitric oxide levels to the blood to treat or prevent cases of congestive heart failure. It was originally designed for a wide population base, and race was irrelevant. But the early clinical studies revealed no compelling results, and an FDA advisory panel voted 9 to 3 against approval.</p>\n\n<p>In a remarkable turn of fate, however, BiDil was suddenly born again as a racialized intervention. This new BiDil trial reflects two problematic assumptions about race and medicine:</p>\n\n<p>The first is that African Americans' risk of developing and dying from heart failure is twice that of whites. This claim has been floating around in the scientific literature for a decade, mainly uncontested. Jonathan Kahn of the University of Minnesota, has just completed some remarkable scientific sleuthing on the topic, however, and has shown that the NitroMed claim about the scope of black and white differences is simply untrue. Kahn traced the citation sources back nearly two decades, and has demonstrated conclusively that the difference between blacks and whites is actually closer to 1.2 to 1. There is a difference, but it is nowhere near the 2-to-1 ratio that would warrant special trials for one population group. Thus, substantial scaffolding of the BiDil clinical trial is based upon incorrect statistical data on racial disparities.</p>\n\n<p>The second claim is that BiDil has a special effect greater on African Americans than whites. The clinical trials now under way are not designed to test that hypothesis. Rather, by concentrating only on blacks, the study can have little or nothing compelling to say about comparative results, by race.</p>\n\n<p>Why the mistake, and what is at stake? Part of the answer lies in the role of prospective markets for biotech products. While the new mantra of biotechnology is to claim that pharmaceuticals will someday soon be marketed to individuals based upon their DNA, the fundamental truth is that selling drugs is about markets. These markets are not about individual designer drugs, but about groups and population aggregates that become the target market.</p>\n\n<p>In a classical piece of epidemiological research, Michael Klag and his associates showed a decade ago that, in general, the darker the skin color, the higher the rate of hypertension for American blacks, even inside the African American community. Klag indicated that the issue was not biological or genetic in origin, but biological in effect due to stress-related outcomes of reduced access to valued social goods such as employment, promotion, housing stock, etc. The effect was biological, not the origins.</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to bring anti-discrimination to the market, and as time goes by, it is harder and harder to bring it to the government's attention.

I prefer being called Mexican to Hispanic, though I've never been to Mexico. I eat a fat American's diet. Speak American English. Although I don't smoke, I have been living in a big city with polluted air. An American city where I recently was an assistant professor of pediatrics, working in a profession that tries to define my indefinable race without asking for my input.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>I helped train medical students and residents who are all taught, as I was when I was a medical student, to assess each patient first in terms of age, race, and gender. Always in that order. A 52-year-old white female, a 3-month-old Asian male, a 39-year-old Hispanic male. The actual identity of patients remains ignored: A 47-year-old African-American female -- who's never been to Africa and prefers to call herself black if ever asked by a white doctor, though no one ever asks -- two-pack-a-day smoker, still living with her mother in South Central Los Angeles, presents with fatigue.</p>\n\n<p>The doctor asks the patient -- or the parent of the patient, if you're a pediatrician -- for his or her age. The gender is determined during the physical exam. But the doctor usually just assumes the patient's race by looking at the person. My professors told me, and current textbooks still say, that knowing the patient's race helps the doctor make an accurate diagnosis. So the doctor looks at the patient's skin, nose, hair, lips -- the silent mouth -- and defines ancestry in a single word: Asian, Hispanic, white, African-American. I smiled when one doctor described the Nigerian father of a patient as an African-American. The Nigerian father didn't smile.</p>\n\n<p>The textbooks say that a patient's race can, and should, influence the doctor's thinking about possible diagnoses. An Ashkenazic Jewish baby might have Tay-Sachs disease. A black boy might have sickle cell anemia. A Southeast Asian girl might have thalassemia. Of course, I know that Ashkenazic Jews get Tay-Sachs, but the only baby I ever saw with Tay-Sachs was a Mexican child. I didn't misdiagnose the disease because he was Mexican instead of Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Do all Hispanics have the same genetic risk for asthma? Do Mexicans and Puerto Ricans eat the same diet? What about a patient from Spain -- is he Hispanic in the same way that I am?</p>\n\n<p>My childhood friend Lela wasn't diagnosed with cystic fibrosis until she was 8 years old. Over the years, her doctors had described her as a \"2-year-old black female with fever and cough ... 4-year-old black girl with another pneumonia. Lela is back.\" Had she been a white child, or had no visible \"race\" at all, she would probably have gotten the correct diagnosis and treatment much earlier. Only when she was 8 did a radiologist, who had never seen her face to face, notice her chest X-ray and ask, \"Who's the kid with CF?\"</p>\n\n<p>An emergency-room physician referred a patient to me with this history: \"A 14 y.o. black male from South Central LA with a positive tox screen presents with headache. He's probably in a gang.\" I ordered a CT scan of the patient's head and discovered a large cyst that had blocked the normal flow of cerebral spinal fluid until the fluid had backed up and squashed his brain against his skull. Yes, he had a headache, and he had smoked a joint before going to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>Those are just two examples of incorrect diagnoses caused by doctors who use racial assumptions to arrive at incorrect medical conclusions. As a physician, such misdiagnoses disturb me. I am also concerned as a father. I am Mexican from California, and my wife is black from Los Angeles. Our daughter is blonde with green eyes and pale skin. I have no known white ancestors, and that kind of heritage -- even if it is just a legend -- would not be left out of my family's stories. In my wife's case, her mother is now tracing their family's roots back through American history; as of 1843, she has not found a single white ancestor. But my wife's relatives generally have fair skin, and I suspect that my mother-in-law will eventually find a slave owner or overseer or some other white man who is responsible for that, and for my daughter's appearance.</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me is that many years from now, when she is old enough to see a doctor with neither me nor my wife present, the doctor will use what he assumes is her race to misdiagnose her: \"A 19-year-old white female presents with irritability.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here is the crux of the problem: My daughter's race can never be known. Her genetic risk for this or that disease is necessarily imprecise because she is a person, not a race.</p>\n\n<p>Americans used to define anyone who had \"one drop of Negro blood\" as a Negro, but we now know that definition makes no sense. We learn nothing if we group together as Asian-Americans a man in Seattle who was born in the far eastern portion of the former Soviet Union, a Korean woman living in Toronto, and a child in California with maternal grandparents who immigrated from China and a father whose ancestors came to New Jersey from Europe. There are almost as many definitions of Hispanic as there are Hispanics. Do I have the same genetic risk for sickle cell anemia as a Puerto Rican, a Spaniard, or a Mayan? What about my daughter, and the millions like her in this country, whose racial and ethnic ancestry defies geography and time?</p>\n\n<p>If by using a patient's ancestry in medical discourse we can narrow the range of possible diagnoses, then at least we must be careful to describe accurately the genetic, ethnic, cultural, or geographical variables involved; guessing what category a person fits in is not acceptable. And when \"race\" cannot possibly matter, let us omit it. What difference does it make if it is an African-American or an Asian who has an earache or ingrown toenail?</p>\n\n<p>Medical-school professors must teach students that a Hispanic is not real. That an Asian-American doesn't exist. That whites exist only in America: They are Irish in Ireland, Italian in Italy, Spaniards in Spain. That harm -- real, physical harm -- can come from calling a child with cystic fibrosis an African-American.</p>\n\n<p>Race does exist in America, alas. It's why my daughter's history here starts in slavery. It's why my Mexican face identifies me to strangers before they know I'm an educated member of the middle class. It's why nobody dares to ask for details about anybody else's identity.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"title":"The idea of race as biology is persistent on America's playing fields, but it is an idea that is not true.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://vimeo.com/newsreeldigital/review/268928749/efc229755c","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f26cce97d96996109da7f5bed5fcc748-ed3056bc1144bb386595c230497645fe.png"}}}},{"title":"At the turn of the 20th century, American society was riding a wave of confidence as an emerging industrial power, and the face of its power and prosperity was white.

That's why anthropology starts off with a recognition that kinship structures social organizations. So, once you get beyond, \"Are you someone I can trust because you're in my family or are you someone I have to be suspicious of because I don't know that much about you,\" I don't think that there's any evidence at all that we're, in any sense, hard wired to trust, feel, or resent people who are from another race. Any more than we would distrust anyone who is from another religion, or dressed funny, or blows their nose too much.</p>\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is that the whole idea of categorizing people into a small number of discreet geographical groups is very strongly located in time and space to 17th-century Europe.
