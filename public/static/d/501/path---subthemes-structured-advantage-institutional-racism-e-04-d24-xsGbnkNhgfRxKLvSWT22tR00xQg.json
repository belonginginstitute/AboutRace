I think the state of racial politics in this country creates for many privileged people a really significant set of personal and political paradoxes. Most people declare their support for the theory of racial equality: rights and privileges, opportunity, fair treatment. And since the civil rights transformations of the 1950s and '60s, many privileged people, especially whites, think that by respecting the letter of civil rights law and by not engaging in obviously offensive acts of discrimination, they are playing by the rules and promoting equality. Here's the paradox, though: since so many of the mechanisms that discriminate, and so many of the mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are not obvious, many people are actually encouraging and perpetuating this inequality - this same inequality that they claim to oppose. So while many people feel strongly that they are not racist, they nonetheless help perpetuate racial inequality, perhaps unknowingly. That's something people need to think about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does the perpetuation of inequality and the denial that it exists do for political culture and daily life in the U.S.? People of color have always organized to protest against racism, and by doing so they have been instrumental in creating a nation that's actually more fair and democratic.

So what happens in political debates and in daily life when whites and others ignore these things, when they insist that there is real equality of opportunity? What happens when people who are in these positions of racial privilege ignore inequality or attribute them to culture or effort? If whites and non-whites, generally speaking, have very different interpretations of the meaning of race in the U.S., it is not a very good recipe for real civic debate and for living in a multi-ethnic or multi-racial country.
