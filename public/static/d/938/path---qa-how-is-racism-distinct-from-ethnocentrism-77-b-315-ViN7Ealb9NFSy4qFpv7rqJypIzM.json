And significantly, the answer to that varies by ethnic group, by a group's particular history in the United States, and even by the period in U.S. history we're talking about. But to bring it up to the present, we cannot generalize about blacks or Asians or Middle Eastern or white immigrants, because their statuses have changed. Nonetheless, there are some things that I would argue are constant. First, the vast majority of immigrants who come to this country do so not just because they want to, but also because they have family, extended family, or other links to immigrant communities here, and those extended immigrant communities provide networks. These networks have access to capital and job markets that help these new immigrants get established and eventually accumulate wealth. Often these localized immigrant middle-class communities can provide connections and opportunities for these newer, equity-poor immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast - and for a number of historical reasons - the black middle class is often not nearly as affluent, nor is their wealth as localized or centralized and therefore cannot provide that same level of support. Furthermore there are simply far more blacks in the United States than there are poor recent immigrants, hence the wealth of their middle-class counterparts is spread even more thinly. This gets back to this issue that is so central to the film series: the long history of the political and economic discrimination against certain racial groups. The black middle class and other minority middle classes are equity poor in large part because of this long history. To this day, it's still comparably much more difficult for certain groups to accumulate wealth. Many immigrants advantaged with easier access to capital through these personal networks are also less likely to be the victims of discrimination by government and private institutions, both in the past and today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it's really important to note that throughout U.S. history, many immigrants have not fared so well. And it's significant to note which groups these are. Hispanic immigrants historically have had a much harder time accumulating wealth than other immigrants, be they European, Asian, or Middle Eastern. Poor black immigrants from the Caribbean, South America, and Africa, have also not fared as well. Likewise, many recent Asian immigrants have come to this country quite destitute, often fleeing political turmoil in the '70s and '80s, and they have likewise struggled in comparison to Asians from other regions, or those who came in other time periods. So I think that if you look at the wide variation in immigrant experience, it provides further evidence that this larger history of discrimination still is a really powerful force. Not all immigrants have been able to establish themselves economically and politically, and more often than not, the immigrants who have generally done best, are those considered white, those who have \"become\" white over time, or those who are considered to be the least threatening to whites in the United States.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n","format":"basic_html","processed":"<p>This is a really big, complicated question.
