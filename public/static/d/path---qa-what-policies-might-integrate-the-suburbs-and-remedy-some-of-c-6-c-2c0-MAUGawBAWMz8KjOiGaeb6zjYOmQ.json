There is a premium in housing values to live in a lily-white community, as opposed to a minority community, or an integrated community. When whites are the majority group and control most of the money, the task of changing that dynamic is very difficult. One way is to create tax incentives and create \"integration insurance\" in the private sector. If I'm a white homeowner and the racial composition of my neighborhood is integrating, I've probably heard that the tipping point for the devaluation of properties is when the percentage of black residents reaches 15 to 20 percent. Therefore, it's in my interest to sell before I think that the neighborhood \"tips,\" because I'm going to lose money if I wait too long and the real estate values decline. Now, even if I'm not personally racist, it's in my economic interest to sell my house. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy - people sell because they're afraid other people are going to sell, and then everyone sells, and neighborhoods just tip completely instead of remaining integrated.</p>\n\n<p>Integration insurance - whether it's provided by the government or local non-profits - would insure against any price changes or any devaluation in your real estate as a result of racial composition in your area. This could potentially break the vicious cycle, because you will have taken away peoples' economic incentive to flee when integration occurs. This has been experimented with in various forms in Oak Park, Illinois, Shaker Heights, Ohio, and I think in Teaneck, New Jersey. These efforts have been fairly successful at these local scales, but again, these are self-selecting communities that have actively sought ways to curb segregation in their neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>On another front, in a move to expand home ownership and racial integration in the suburbs, the Ford Foundation gave its largest single grant to an organization called Self Help to underwrite mortgages for low-income, predominantly minority populations much in the way that the FHA and the VA underwrote mortgages in the post-World War II period. The $50 million grant leveraged two billion dollars in low-interest, low-income mortgages.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>There is one other very radical solution, but there would be no political support: just get rid of the tax credits or the tax advantages of homeownership. You wouldn't find any political support for it, but essentially that's the mechanism that created the middle class and also created racial inequity through homeownership and real estate. The different mechanisms people are talking about are basically ways of changing how people actually decide the value of their homes. In other words, introducing some sort of financial incentive for people not to make certain choices. This is a great example of how people's individual choices perpetuate racism in a way that they don't obviously think about. So it's a great way to illustrate how our choices actually can change these systems. Choosing not to sell your home immediately - even if the financial value might go down - when blacks or anybody else moves into your neighborhood is a great example because the \"value\" of your home isn't just financial.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"David Freund"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>In terms of resources on this, I would like to refer people to two sources on metropolitics. john a. powell's work on race, poverty, and urban sprawl and why urban sprawl is a civil rights issue, and Myron Orfield's book, American Metropolitics.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-what-policies-might-integrate-the-suburbs-and-remedy-some-of-c6c","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhatPoliciesMightIntegrateTheSuburbsAndRemedySomeOf","path":"/qa/what-policies-might-integrate-the-suburbs-and-remedy-some-of","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"1c382381-6d3d-44a5-83de-be1ae265ea5f"},"updatedAt":1531332572321,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"1c382381-6d3d-44a5-83de-be1ae265ea5f"}}
