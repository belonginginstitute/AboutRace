But many peoples throughout history have been enslaved without the imposition of racial ideology. When we look at 17th century colonial America before the enactment of laws legitimizing slavery only for Africans and their descendants (after 1660), several facts become clear.</p>\n\n<p>1) The first people that the English tried to enslave and place on plantations were the Irish with whom they had had hostile relations since the 13th century.</p>\n\n<p>2) Some Englishmen had proposed laws enslaving the poor in England and in the colonies to force them to work indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>3) Most of the slaves on English plantations in Barbados and Jamaica were Irish and Indians.</p>\n\n<p>4) Many historians point out that African servants and bonded indentured white servants were treated much the same way. They often joined together, as in the case of Bacon's Rebellion (1676) to oppose the strict and oppressive laws of the colonial government.</p>\n\n<p>In the latter part of the 17th century the demand for labor grew enormously. It had become clear that neither Irishmen nor Indians made good slaves. More than that, the real threats to social order were the poor freed whites who demanded lands and privileges that the upper class colonial governments refused. Some colonial leaders argued that turning to African labor provided a buffer against the masses of poor whites.</p>\n\n<p>Until the 18th century the image of Africans was generally positive. They were farmers and cattle-breeders; they had industries, arts and crafts, governments and commerce. In addition, Africans had immunities to Old World diseases. They were better laborers and they had nowhere to escape to once transplanted to the New World. The colonists themselves came to believe that they could not survive without Africans.</p>\n\n<p>When some Englishmen entered slave trading directly, it became clear that many of the English public had misgivings about slave-trading and re-creating slavery on English soil. It was an era when the ideals of equality, justice, democracy, and human rights were becoming dominant features of Western political philosophy. Those involved in the trade rationalized their actions by arguing that the Africans were heathens after all, and it was a Christian duty to save their souls. By the early part of the 18th century, the institution was fully established for Africans and their descendants. Large numbers of slaves flooded the southern colonies and even some northern ones. Sometimes they outnumbered whites, and the laws governing slavery became increasingly harsher.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A New Social Identity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the image of Africans began to change dramatically. The major catalyst for this transformation was the rise of a powerful antislavery movement that expanded and strengthened during the Revolutionary Era both in Europe and in the United States. As a consequence proslavery forces found it necessary to develop new arguments for defending the institution. Focusing on physical differences, they turned to the notion of the natural inferiority of Africans and thus their God-given suitability for slavery. Such arguments became more frequent and strident from the end of the eighteenth century on, and the characterizations of Africans became more negative.</p>\n\n<p>From here we see the structuring of the ideological components of \"race.\" The term \"race,\" which had been a classificatory term like \"type,\" or \"kind,\" but with ambiguous meaning, became more widely used in the eighteenth century, and crystallized into a distinct reference for Africans, Indians and Europeans. By focusing on the physical and status differences between the conquered and enslaved peoples, and Europeans, the emerging ideology linked the socio-political status and physical traits together and created a new form of social identity. Proslavery leaders among the colonists formulated a new ideology that merged all Europeans together, rich and poor, and fashioned a social system of ranked physically distinct groups. The model for \"race\" and \"races\" was the Great Chain of Being or Scale of Nature (Scala Naturae), a semi-scientific theory of a natural hierarchy of all living things, derived from classical Greek writings. The physical features of different groups became markers or symbols of their status on this scale, and thus justified their positions within the social system. Race ideology proclaimed that the social, spiritual, moral, and intellectual inequality of different groups was, like their physical traits, natural, innate, inherited, and unalterable.</p>\n\n<p>Thus was created the only slave system in the world that became exclusively \"racial.\" By limiting perpetual servitude to Africans and their descendants, colonists were proclaiming that blacks would forever be at the bottom of the social hierarchy. By keeping blacks, Indians and whites socially and spatially separated and enforcing endogamous mating, they were making sure that visible physical differences would be preserved as the premier insignia of unequal social statuses. From its inception separateness and inequality was what \"race\" was all about. The attributes of inferior race status came to be applied to free blacks as well as slaves. In this way, \"race\" was configured as an autonomous new mechanism of social differentiation that transcended the slave condition and persisted as a form of social identity long after slavery ended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Humans as Property</strong></p>\n\n<p>American slavery was unique in another way; that is, how North American slave-owners resolved the age-old dilemma of all slave systems. Slaves are both persons and things--human beings and property. How do you treat a human being as both person and property? And what should take precedence, the human rights of the slave or the property rights of the master? American laws made clear that property was more sacred than people, and the property rights of masters overshadowed the human rights of slaves. Said Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the famous Dred Scott case of 1857, \"Negroes were seen only as property; they were never thought of or spoken of except as property\" and \"(thus) were not intended by the framers of the Constitution to be accorded citizenship rights.\"</p>\n\n<p>In order to transform people solely into property, you must minimize those qualities that make them human. Literature of the early nineteenth century began to portray \"the negro\" as a savage in even stronger terms than those that had been used for the Irish two centuries earlier. This was a major transformation in thought about who Africans were. Historian George Fredrickson states explicitly that \"before 1830 open assertions of permanent black inferiority were exceedingly rare\" (The Black Image in the White Mind, 1987). By mid-century, the ideology of \"negro inferiority\" dominated both popular and scholarly thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Science and the Justification for \"Races\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas. Scholarly writers began attempting to prove scientifically that \"the Negro\" was a different and lower kind of human being. The first published materials arguing from a scientific perspective that \"negroes\" were a separate species from white men appeared in the last decade of the eighteenth century. They argued that Negroes were either a product of degeneration from that first creation, or descendants of a separate creation altogether.</p>\n\n<p>American intellectuals appropriated, and rigidified, the categories of human groups established by European scholars during the eighteenth century, but ignored Blumenbach's caution that human groups blend insensibly into one another, so that it is impossible to place precise boundaries around them.</p>\n\n<p>When Dr. Samuel Morton in the 1830s initiated the field of craniometry, the first school of American anthropology, proponents of race ideology received the most powerful scientific support yet. Measuring the insides of crania collected from many populations, he offered \"evidence\" that the Negro had a smaller brain than whites, with Indians in-between. Morton is also famous for his involvement in a major scientific controversy over creation.</p>\n\n<p>The very existence of a scientific debate over whether blacks and whites were products of a single creation, or of multiple creations, especially in a society dominated by Biblical explanations, seems anomalous. It indicates that the differences between \"races\" had been so magnified and exaggerated that popular consciousness had already widely accepted the idea of blacks being a different and inferior species of humans. Justice Taney's decision reflected this, declaring, \"the negro is a different order of being.\" Thus slave-owners' rights to their \"property\" were upheld in law by appeal to the newly invented identity of peoples from Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists collaborated in confirming popular beliefs, and publications appeared on a regular basis providing the \"proof\" that comforted the white public. That some social leaders were conscious of their role in giving credibility to the invented myths is manifest in statements such as that found in the Charleston Medical Journal after Dr. Morton's death. It states, \"We can only say that we of the South should consider him as our benefactor, for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race\". George Gliddon, co-editor of a famous scientific book Types of Mankind, (1854) which argued that Negroes were closer to apes than to humans and ranked all other groups between whites and Negroes, sent a copy of the book to a famous southern politician, saying that he was sure the south would appreciate the powerful support that this book gave for its \"peculiar institution\" (slavery). Like another famous tome (The Bell Curve, 1995) this was an 800-page book whose first edition sold out immediately; it went through nine other editions before the end of the century. What it said about the inferiority of blacks became widely known, even by those who could not read it.</p>\n\n<p>During discussions in the U.S. Senate on the future of \"the negro\" after slavery, James Henry Hammond proclaimed in 1858 \"somebody has to be the mudsills of society, to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life.\" Negroes were destined to be the mudsills. This was to be their place, one consciously created for them by a society whose cultural values now made it impossible to assimilate them. In the many decades since the Civil War, white society made giant strides to \"keep the negro in his place.\" Public policies and the customs and practices of millions of Americans expressed this racial worldview throughout the twentieth century.</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the circumstances surrounding the origin of the racial worldview in North America. Race ideology was a mechanism justifying what had already been established as unequal social groups; it was from its inception, and is today, about who should have access to privilege, power, status, and wealth, and who should not. As a useful political ideology for conquerors, it spread into colonial situations around the world. It was promulgated in the latter half of the 19th century by some Europeans against other Europeans and reached its most extreme development in the twentieth century Nazi holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>All anthropologists should understand that \"race\" has no intrinsic relationship to human biological diversity, that such diversity is a natural product of primarily evolutionary forces while \"race\" is a social invention.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"4d190c01-d90d-4e52-aa8a-150cf47432df","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>An ideological basis for explicit racism came to a unique fruition in the West during the modern period.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2004, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"George M.

An ideological basis for explicit racism came to a unique fruition in the West during the modern period. No clear and unequivocal evidence of racism has been found in other cultures or in Europe before the Middle Ages. The identification of the Jews with the devil and witchcraft in the popular mind of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was perhaps the first sign of a racist view of the world. Official sanction for such attitudes came in sixteenth century Spain when Jews who had converted to Christianity and their descendants became the victims of a pattern of discrimination and exclusion.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>The period of the Renaissance and Reformation was also the time when Europeans were coming into increasing contact with people of darker pigmentation in Africa, Asia, and the Americas and were making judgments about them. The official rationale for enslaving Africans was that they were heathens, but slave traders and slave owners sometimes interpreted a passage in the book of Genesis as their justification. Ham, they maintained, committed a sin against his father Noah that condemned his supposedly black descendants to be \"servants unto servants.\" When Virginia decreed in 1667 that converted slaves could be kept in bondage, not because they were actual heathens but because they had heathen ancestry, the justification for black servitude was thus changed from religious status to something approaching race. Beginning in the late seventeenth century laws were also passed in English North America forbidding marriage between whites and blacks and discriminating against the mixed offspring of informal liaisons. Without clearly saying so, such laws implied that blacks were unalterably alien and inferior.</p>\n\n<p>During the Enlightenment, a secular or scientific theory of race moved the subject away from the Bible, with its insistence on the essential unity of the human race. Eighteenth century ethnologists began to think of human beings as part of the natural world and subdivided them into three to five races, usually considered as varieties of a single human species. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however, an increasing number of writers, especially those committed to the defense of slavery, maintained that the races constituted separate species. </p>\n\n<p>The Nineteenth century was an age of emancipation, nationalism, and imperialism--all of which contributed to the growth and intensification of ideological racism in Europe and the United States. Although the emancipation of blacks from slavery and Jews from the ghettos received most of its support from religious or secular believers in an essential human equality, the consequence of these reforms was to intensify rather than diminish racism. Race relations became less paternalistic and more competitive. The insecurities of a burgeoning industrial capitalism created a need for scapegoats. The Darwinian emphasis on \"the struggle for existence\" and concern for \"the survival of the fittest\" was conducive to the development of a new and more credible scientific racism in an era that increasingly viewed race relations as an arena for conflict rather than as a stable hierarchy. </p>\n\n<p>The growth of nationalism, especially romantic cultural nationalism, encouraged the growth of a culture-coded variant of racist thought, especially in Germany. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, the coiners of the term \"antisemitism\" made explicit what some cultural nationalists had previously implied--that to be Jewish in Germany was not simply to adhere to a set of religious beliefs or cultural practices but meant belonging to a race that was the antithesis of the race to which true Germans belonged.</p>\n\n<p>The climax of Western imperialism in the late nineteenth century \"scramble for Africa\" and parts of Asia and the Pacific represented an assertion of the competitive ethnic nationalism that existed among European nations (and which, as a result of the Spanish-American War came to include the United States). It also constituted a claim, allegedly based on science, that Europeans had the right to rule over Africans and Asians.</p>\n\n<p>The climax of the history of racism came in the twentieth century in the rise and fall of what might be called overtly racist regimes. In the American South, the passage of racial segregation laws and restrictions on black voting rights reduced African Americans to lower caste status. Extreme racist propaganda, which represented black males as ravening beasts lusting after white women, served to rationalize the practice of lynching. A key feature of the racist regime maintained by state law in the South was a fear of sexual contamination through rape or intermarriage, which led to efforts to prevent the conjugal union of whites with those with any known or discernable African ancestry. </p>\n\n<p>Racist ideology was eventually of course carried to its extreme in Nazi Germany. It took Hitler and his cohorts to attempt the extermination of an entire ethnic group on the basis of a racist ideology. Hitler, it has been said, gave racism a bad name. The moral revulsion of people throughout the world against what the Nazis did, reinforced by scientific studies undermining racist genetics (or eugenics), served to discredit the scientific racism that had been respectable and influential in the United States and Europe before the Second World War. </p>\n\n<p>Explicit racism also came under devastating attack from the new nations resulting from the decolonization of Africa and Asia and their representatives in the United Nations. The Civil Rights movement in the United States, which succeeded in outlawing legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the 1960s drew crucial support from the growing sense that national interests were threatened when blacks in the United States were mistreated and abused. In the competition with the Soviet Union for \"the hearts and minds\" of independent Africans and Asians, Jim Crow and the ideology that sustained it became a national embarrassment with possible strategic consequences.</p>\n\n<p>The one racist regime that survived the Second World War and the Cold War was the South African in 1948. The laws passed banning all marriage and sexual relations between different \"population groups\" and requiring separate residential areas for people of mixed race (\"Coloreds\"), as well as for Africans, signified the same obsession with \"race purity\" that characterized the other racist regimes. However the climate of world opinion in the wake of the Holocaust induced apologists for apartheid to avoid, for the most part, straightforward biological racism and rest their case for \"separate development\" mainly on cultural rather than physical differences. </p>\n\n<p>The defeat of Nazi Germany, the desegregation of the American South in the 1960s, and the establishment of majority rule in South Africa suggest that regimes based on biological racism or its cultural essentialist equivalent are a thing of the past. But racism does not require the full and explicit support of the state and the law. Nor does it require an ideology centered on the concept of biological inequality. Discrimination by institutions and individuals against those perceived as racially different can long persist and even flourish under the illusion of non-racism, as historians of Brazil have recently discovered. The use of allegedly deep-seated cultural differences as a justification for hostility and discrimination against newcomers from the Third World in several European countries has led to allegations of a new \"cultural racism.\" Recent examples of a functionally racist cultural determinism are not in fact unprecedented. They rather represent a reversion to the way that the differences between groups could be made to seem indelible and unbridgeable before the articulation of a scientific or naturalistic conception of race in the eighteenth century.</p>"}}],"clips":null,"interviews":[{"__typename":"node__interview","title":"Interview with Karen Ordahl Kupperman","changed":1528242883,"field_interviewee_name":{"processed":"Karen Ordahl Kupperman"},"field_interviewee_bio":{"processed":"Karen Ordahl Kupperman is a professor of history at New York University.

But also I think the Spanish, especially what they saw as aggressive Spanish Catholicism, was a kind of Other for the English, probably a much more powerful kind of Other than the way we would construe racial or ethnic Others. Their opponents in these great world historical dramas are the Other as far as they are concerned.</p>\n\n<p>English people in general expected to be able to tell a lot about a person by what that person wore. You could tell if a woman was married or unmarried by the way she wore her hair. You could tell often even which part of the country someone was from by their clothes. Certainly you could distinguish their rank. The Sumptuary Laws meant that you had to be of a certain rank to wear certain kinds of ornamentation. And punishments were pretty severe if you tried to countervene those laws.</p>\n\n<p>So the idea was that your presentation to the world should tell the truth about your status, who you were, what rank you were, what you did, where you came from, and people expected clothes to do all that work.</p>\n\n<p>The English in the Elizabethan period try to bring Ireland under control and they do it very much the same way that they will eventually do it in America, that is, by conquest but also by sending over settlers. They write about the Irish in a very contemptuous way. In fact, they use words and phrases that they wouldn't use of the Indians. The Irish are not just savage, they are stubborn savages. The Irish are people who have been repeatedly offered this superior civility that the English are purveying and the Irish have rejected it. And so there is a real brutality in the wars to subdue the Irish.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the people who went to the early colonies had been in Ireland and so it is not so much that a kind of abstract lesson is drawn but it is simply the same people carrying out similar policies in America.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the English view the Indians they encountered?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't say that the English looked upon the Indians with high esteem. I think the respect that the English felt for the Indians was the respect of fear. They were very conscious of the fact that the Indians lived well in an environment that they found absolutely baffling. They felt vulnerable all the time. So they respected the Indians. They thought of the Indian leaders, people like Powhatan, as awe-inspiring leaders.</p>\n\n<p>But at the same time they also thought of them as savages, they thought of them as people who needed to be brought into civility. I think they looked upon the Indians as formidable. Formidable is the word I think I would chose.</p>\n\n<p>The Indians were organized in tribes, sometimes at village levels, sometimes collections of villages. The English called Powhatan 'The Great Emperor Powhatan' as he was the overlord of more than 30 tribes in the Chesapeake at the time that Jamestown was founded. An emperor is a king who rules over other kings. And who has no one over him. And that was an exact description of what they perceived: Powhatan was a great ruler who had many rulers at the village level under him and therefore he was an emperor in English terms.</p>\n\n<p>So they have a lot of respect for people like Powhatan, which also reflected their understanding that Powhatan could at any time wipe them out if he so chose. So it is respect based in part at least on fear and vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did the English view the Indians as a separate 'race'?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Color is not a determining characteristic in this period. In the first place, the English don't think of the Indians as being of a different color. Every account that talks about color says that the Indians are born white, and that they artificially darken their skin in one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>The Indians darken their skin either using walnut juice or some other kind of substance or by becoming tanned by going outside in the sunshine, because they have reason for wanting to be darker. But anybody who talks about color in the early days says emphatically that the Indians are naturally white.</p>\n\n<p>So they think of the Indians as being culturally different. But with respect to terms that we today might use to talk about race or color, the English think of them as being similar to themselves.</p>\n\n<p>In fact one of the most interesting question for the English was, What Old World people are the Indians descended from? And they looked for known diasporas in the ancient world that might have resulted in the Indians coming to America. Such as the diaspora of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Many people thought the Indians might be descended from them. Some people thought they were Trojan descendants - there were various hypotheses. But every English person who wrote about it assumed that the Indians came from some known Old World source.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the story of Pocahontas tell us about English ideas of race and difference?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When John Rolfe, who had developed the tobacco crop, wanted to marry Pocahontas, he wrote a long letter to the governor of the Jamestown colony talking about his feelings for Pocahontas and he was very concerned that even though she had been converted to Christianity, there are some prohibitions in the Bible against marrying heathens and marrying into heathens' lineages. But his letter never talks about her in what we would consider to be racial terms. It is entirely religious categories.</p>\n\n<p>Pocahontas and John Rolfe then had a son Thomas, and they went to England. She would have been 20 at the time. They were received at Court. She was an immediate sensation. A portrait of her, an engraving, was rushed into print. And everywhere they went they caused a flurry of interest.</p>\n\n<p>They went to a masque at Court, one of these great pageants, and she was a media sensation in England - it was quite an event. I think it says a lot about the lack of racial thinking, because the fact that Pocahontas was the daughter of a king was the most important fact about her, not that she's an Indian. That is a very graphic illustration of the fact that the English did not yet think in racial terms. Status and religion were more important. Pocahontas was received so well in London because she was royalty and she was received as royalty.</p>\n\n<p>And some people even argued at the time that Rolfe was actually marrying above himself. Because even though he was from an old and distinguished family in England, he was not of a rank sufficient to marry a king's daughter and that this marriage was inappropriate for that reason.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the Indians view the English?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, all we know is what the English wrote down. There is no written source from an Indian hand in this early period in North America. And the English try very hard often to transmit what the Indians are telling them. But it is very hard for us to answer the question like that.</p>\n\n<p>I think a man like Powhatan was very experienced with Europeans by the time Jamestown was founded. There had actually been a Potawatomi man who had spent almost a decade travelling with the Spanish in Spain, Havana, Mexico City and then had returned to the Potawatomi people so they knew a lot about Europe and Europeans and how they operate. And it seems pretty clear to me that Powhatan thought it would be useful to have the English there.</p>\n\n<p>He looks at Jamestown and he see a little over a hundred people, all men, not very competent, but they are the source of European manufactured goods. There are certain kinds of tools in particular, particularly metal tools that can hold an edge, that the Indians wanted. And I think Powhatan thought that it would be convenient to have these people here as a source of trade goods. He never dreamed that he wouldn't be able to control them.</p>\n\n<p>And so Powhatan allows Jamestown's early settlement. He sort of specifies what land they can settle on and to some extent allows them to have a pretty steady food supply in the early years.</p>\n\n<p>I have often wondered if Powhatan could have seen the thousands of people who would be coming to Virginia ten years after the straggling little colony of Jamestown was first founded, what his initial response would have been.</p>\n\n<p>I mean he could easily have vanquished the Jamestown settlers in the beginning by wiping them out. Or in fact all he has to do is move away and withdraw the source of food that they are dependent on, and that does it for Jamestown.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What else distinguishes the Indians from the English?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think one of the most important differences between the English and the Algonquins - all of the Indians that the English encountered in the early years were Algonquins - had to do with issues of ownership. English people owned property and owned land and they expected part of the payoff for taking this huge risk of coming to America was to get land of their own.</p>\n\n<p>And that was not a concept that the Indians followed. I mean each village owned land. Individual Indians didn't take a plot and say, \"This is mine, and I will farm it forever intensively.\"</p>\n\n<p>So the Indians expected to use a wide range of resources over a fairly extensive land base, and I think a lot of the clashes in the early years continuing through the colonial period really came over questions of land use. Because the European way of using land prevented the Indians from using land in the way that they had always done. I think that is one of the biggest cultural differences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What cultural characteristics of the settlers exacerbated the conflict with the Indians?</strong></p>\n\n<p>English men in this period, particularly those of higher rank, believed that you could never allow yourself to be vulnerable. That if you were vulnerable you invited treachery, and that if you were the victim of treachery you had made yourself vulnerable and it was your own fault. I think that conditions a lot of the early actions in the colonies, particularly ones that are exclusively male, as Roanoke and Jamestown both were in the early days. Because they are extremely vulnerable - they can't cope, they can't feed themselves, they are living in constant fear. They are not really well-planned colonies.</p>\n\n<p>So they come with this knowledge of their own vulnerability. And their way of coping with that, since to be vulnerable is to invite treachery, I think, is to always act as though they are invulnerable, to act as though they are the stronger party even though they are not.</p>\n\n<p>So you see, for example, Captain John Smith seizes a child when he goes into a village, and holds the child hostage. The English tend to overreact for every wrong, real or imagined, that they think has been done them.</p>\n\n<p>The worst example that I know of is in Roanoke, the first colony. When they arrive their ship promptly runs aground on the Outer Banks of Carolina. They don't realize how shallow the ocean around the Outer Banks actually is. So the ship that carried all of their food supplies, \"The Tiger,\" ran aground. All of their food was spoiled except for about ten days worth of grain.</p>\n\n<p>They decided they will stay anyway. The men who are going to stay in Roanoke set about building a rudimentary settlement. It is already well into the summer by this time so there is no chance for them to plant food or anything like that.</p>\n\n<p>And while these men are building this settlement, the sailors with Sir Richard Grenville, commander of the expedition, go exploring in the Sound between the Outer Banks and the coast of Carolina. They discovered one day that a silver cup was missing from their luggage that they were carrying around and they decided that it had been stolen at the Indian village that they had visited two days previously. So they went back to that village and burned it to the ground.</p>\n\n<p>At first sight you would think that this was an act of madness. When you are about to leave 100 men with no food, it was already late in the summer, alienating the Indians would seem to be the least reasonable course of action. But I think from the standpoint of someone like Grenville, it was the only thing he could do because he saw it as a challenge. And if he had allowed a challenge to go unpunished then he would have been showing that he was weak and he would have been inviting all kinds of treachery.</p>\n\n<p>So I think this is the mindset of English men, especially the gentry, coming to America. You always have to put on a show of your strength and power, especially if you are extremely weak and vulnerable, and that is what Grenville was doing in that case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We often hear that the Indians thought the Europeans were gods.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some English people say that the Indians think of us as gods. But clearly the Indians were very, very aware of the limits of English power and capability. I think there is no evidence that any English person was conceived of as a god. Most of those accounts come from people writing about the encounter who are actually a generation or so removed.</p>\n\n<p>Thomas Hariot, though, says that the Indians thought we were risen spirits, dead people who have returned to this life. And that's because these Old World diseases are just ripping through Indian populations, but the Europeans don't get them and so one of the questions always is why is this happening? Why is God choosing to visit disease on these people and not on the Europeans? And I think both Indians and Europeans by and large believed that nothing in the universe happens without God's will. So this has to represent some kind of judgement of God.</p>\n\n<p>The English don't settle in North America until after a century of contact. So the Indian population figures that the English cite are already of very, very much reduced populations. Some historians estimate that as many as 90% of the Indians died during the first century of sustained contact, and there are epidemics that Europeans describe where they say not one in ten is left alive.</p>\n\n<p>Those epidemics didn't hit every region, or they hit different regions at different times, but these diseases skew everything. You can't really talk about anything about the encounter without understanding that this is the most fundamental problem.</p>\n\n<p>And so Hariot says that the way the Roanokes explained the English resistance to disease was that they were risen spirits. And in Jamestown, Captain John Smith was interviewing a captive who came from the Piedmont region, who actually was from a Sioux speaking tribe, and he asked him, \"Who do you think we are?\" And this captive said, \"We think you are a people come from under the world to take our world from us.\" A very poignant statement. Hariot and others talked about Indian beliefs that when people die they go into another world. And they live a complete life in this other world, and when they die in that world they then come back into this world and live another life in this world. So it is a kind of cyclical alternation between these two worlds.</p>\n\n<p>So I think what Hariot is describing is that they think the English are dead people who have in fact returned into this life. This is part of a natural process. It doesn't mean that you are some kind of special supernatural being; it just means that you are at a different stage in this process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do the Indians think of themselves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We don't actually know very much about how Indians thought of themselves but there is one story that I think is quite revealing, in the writings of Roger Williams up in New England.</p>\n\n<p>Williams is one of the very few people who really knew an Indian language well. And he said that the Indians didn't have any word for `Indian' before the English came because they didn't need one, because there was no categorical difference. They had words for each other in terms of a tribal name or village name, and then they had a word for the whole human race - people.</p>\n\n<p>And he said that they had started calling themselves `Indians' when they had a need for such a word, to distinguish themselves from Europeans. They used the word Indian because it was a convenient word to use.</p>\n\n<p>Which I think is a sort of illustration of how for everybody involved in these early relationships the categories are still being invented, both the categories by which we talk about other people but also the categories by which we talk about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What motivated the early English colonization ventures?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The English overseas ventures of trade and colonization were all organized by joint stock companies. People came together to form these sort of rudimentary corporations. They tended to be very short term - some of them like the Virginia Company, the Massachusetts Bay Company, were very long term - but mostly a corporation would be formed for a single voyage and the affairs of the corporation would be wound up at the at the end of that voyage.</p>\n\n<p>There was no limited liability then. These were very high risk ventures. Any one investor could be held responsible for the debts of the whole company. England has to do it this way; England can't have government-sponsored colonization because the country is simply too poor to do that.</p>\n\n<p>What it means is that the English ventures are always under pressure to make a profit. We talk today about how companies are always looking to the next quarterly report, but that is true with a vengeance in these early corporations because the affairs are going to be wound up at the end of this voyage or venture. And so, short-term thinking tends to pervade these things. They are much more interested in immediate profits and of course they don't get immediate profits out of American ventures. Or out of many kinds of ventures.</p>\n\n<p>The stakes were extremely high. I mean they are gambling, essentially gambling everything. They have no idea really what is going to happen to them once they get to America, and of course the voyage itself is pretty miserable. I mean, there are no cabins or anything. People just have a blanket that they roll up in wherever they can find a space, and if it is stormy and everybody is under the deck and the bilge water is going back and forth and it is probably full of all kinds of waste. It is almost inconceivable I think to imagine what it must have been like in those ships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do the English colonial ventures find once they get to North America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Basically, North America didn't have much to offer the English. The model was Spain in South America and Mexico which had found gold and silver and other precious commodities. In the far north similarly the French had formed this relationship with native groups in the fur trade and furs were very valuable, feeding the luxury trade for beaver hats, for felt hats.</p>\n\n<p>But the English were late on the scene and they had to take what was left, and what was left was the east coast of North America. And there were no commodities there.</p>\n\n<p>So that is one of the reasons why the English colonies stumbled around for the first decade or so until John Rolfe, who ultimately married Pocahontas, experimented with tobacco seeds, probably seeds that he had picked up in Bermuda, and found a tobacco that would grow in Virginia in its relatively short growing season but would be acceptable to the European tastes, that would sell in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Once tobacco is in place it becomes the gold of Virginia. But it has to be grown by an Old World labor source. It is not a product that the English can acquire through trade with the Indians [like the French fur traders] which would have been their first choice.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"5f13c4cd-25f4-4114-bf5f-bf3063cb9704","name":"Founding Race: Enslavement and Indian Removal","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}},{"id":"9f581c9d-e57e-46bd-b44d-427baf483f2e","name":"Founding Race: Race and Democracy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"e2b3298a-a33d-4bc3-94b3-0c9a63f7a7c2","name":"Making Whiteness: Whiteness and Class","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Civilization","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Myth of the Savage","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Indian Removal","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}}],"field_interviewee":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/6abdb1b2a8fda2b3457d6f40c7b9b7d8-0f94a00a17000b6aaed8f40a72f53602.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"abc070f3-ee92-573c-a68d-49f6f0871274 >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1000,"height":659,"src":"/Race2/static/6abdb1b2a8fda2b3457d6f40c7b9b7d8-0f94a00a17000b6aaed8f40a72f53602.jpg"},"sizes":{"src":"/Race2/static/6abdb1b2a8fda2b3457d6f40c7b9b7d8-0f94a00a17000b6aaed8f40a72f53602-381d6.jpg"},"resolutions":{"height":264,"width":400,"src":"/Race2/static/6abdb1b2a8fda2b3457d6f40c7b9b7d8-0f94a00a17000b6aaed8f40a72f53602-10d9a.jpg"}}}}}},{"__typename":"node__interview","title":"Interview with James O.

Columbus was not coming to explore really. He was coming to look for a shorter, more profitable route for extracting the riches of the East. And Jamestown was founded by a joint stock holding company. From the very beginning, European colonization was very much a commercial, capitalistic enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>As the British were making their initial forays into North America, their expectations were based on the example of the Spanish. The Spanish had made unbelievable amounts of wealth from mining the gold and silver in Latin America. That gold and silver made Spain the richest country in the world. Seeing this, the English thought, we better get in on this colonization movement, and they moved into British North America - specifically the area we know today as Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>Well, there's just not much gold and silver in Virginia. Never has been. And they quickly learned that they were not going to repeat the experience of the Spanish. They were not going to become rich by taking gold and silver out of their colonies. So they turned to another valuable resource. And in Virginia that valuable resource turned out to be tobacco.</p>\n\n<p>Tobacco farming, producing tobacco that was sold in Europe, turned out to be very valuable, very profitable. But very labor intensive. There was always the need to get more and more people to work in the tobacco fields of Virginia and Maryland. They tried it with white indentured servants. And that worked for a while. But they couldn't get enough white indentured servants to come and work for long enough. And in 1619, when 20 or so Africans were brought to Jamestown, by a Dutch frigate, and these Africans were purchased, they were used in the labor system producing tobacco.</p>\n\n<p>Now several things happened at this time. First of all the first Africans were not necessarily treated as slaves. They were not held for life, and their status did not generally pass on to their ancestors, to their descendants. But they were used in the production of tobacco, and increasingly, more and more Africans were brought in to help produce tobacco. By the time we get to 1700, Africans are used extensively in the production of tobacco, in Virginia and Maryland, and rice is starting to be grown in the early 18th century in South Carolina.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why were Africans enslaved, rather than, for example, American Indians?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You know, when the first British came to Virginia, they came expecting to find a workforce available to them. What had happened in Latin America and the Caribbean is that the Spanish had exploited Indian labor and decimated Indian population in terms of disease and in terms of working these people to death. Indians died by the tens of thousands in those places.</p>\n\n<p>When the British landed in Virginia they fully expected to find native peoples who they could force to work for them. Whose labor they could exploit. But instead, they found tribes that were more powerful than they had expected. And they found that there weren't enough native peoples. A lot of the native peoples died from diseases that the Europeans brought with them.</p>\n\n<p>But this brings up an interesting question. How difficult do you suspect it is to enslave a person on their home ground with allies immediately available?</p>\n\n<p>In British North America, Native Americans fought. And there were substantial numbers of them, at least enough of them to put up a formidable resistance. The fact is that the colonists could not find the numbers of Native Americans to exploit and so they turned to other sources. They turned to whites in Europe and lots of whites were imported as indentured servants, to work in the fields.</p>\n\n<p>But when they found Africans, they found what they considered an endless labor supply. People who could be readily identified and so when they ran away they couldn't just melt into the population like Native Americans could. People who had the skills that they needed. People who knew how to grow tobacco, people who knew how to grow rice. They found the ideal from their standpoint, the ideal labor source.</p>\n\n<p>And so these were people who could provide the labor and who could also provide the skill, and so they were used extensively in rice growing in South Carolina and in tobacco growing in the Chesapeake Bay area. And it really is on the basis of their work and their skill that a colonial economy is being built, which never matches the vast wealth that the Spanish were getting from Latin America, but does provide an increasingly important foundation for the English economy.</p>\n\n<p>At some point late in the 18th century, or the middle of that century, there was a conscious decision that Africans would become the laborers of choice. And from that point on what you find is a decrease in the number of white indentured servants. Because African slave labor is proving more plentiful, and more profitable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did racial ideas develop in early America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There have always been differences between people, and sometimes those differences were defined by religions, sometimes ethnicity, sometimes family unit, sometimes national unit. But increasingly as we get into the American historical context, as we move into the 18th century, that difference starts to be defined in racial terms.</p>\n\n<p>This is not something that happens immediately, it happens slowly over time. If you look in the 18th century there are plenty of examples of blacks and whites who are lumped together on the basis of where they stand in the society.</p>\n\n<p>In the 18th century, for example, there is this status, unfreedom - that is, people who are not free. Now some of those people are slaves, and some of those people are indentured servants. Now whites could be indentured servants, and that was a state of unfreedom. It was very different than slavery but it was certainly a state of unfreedom.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that I think we don't realize is that upwards of 80 percent of Europeans - white Europeans - who came to British North America came in a state of indentured servitude. An indentured servant sells his or her labor - not person but labor - for some specified period of time, generally seven years, but that could vary, to someone who needs a laborer in the British North American colonies. Then that person is held in the state of indentured servitude for a period of time and works for his or her master. At the end of your indenture, you were free.</p>\n\n<p>Slavery was a very different institution but for the period of time that the indentured servant was an indentured servant, that person had very few rights. And that person was worked in a way that provided advantage to his or her master. So there were many ways in which the life of an indentured servant paralleled the life of a slave.</p>\n\n<p>Blacks could be indentured servants and they could be slaves. But if you read the accounts of some of the colonial elites in American society, they often will refer to those at the bottom of society in ways that make it very clear that they have lumped these people together. And in response, you often find that blacks and whites, who are at the bottom of American society in the state of unfreedom, often find that shared condition of unfreedom to be a fine foundation for building alliances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Africans and poor Europeans make common cause?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most Americans don't recognize the extent to which interracial alliances in American society - in protest movements and movements to bring about better conditions for people at the bottom of the economic scale - have a long history in American society.</p>\n\n<p>We can go back to 1676, for example, when in Virginia there was an uprising called Bacon's Rebellion. It started out as a rebellion against Native Americans but wound up as a rebellion against the colonial elites of the Colony of Virginia. In fact, the capital of Virginia was burned and the governor was driven out of the colonial capital. This was an alliance of black slaves, white indentured servants, and lower class whites - who were all protesting conditions that inhibited their freedom and limited their opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>This was an alliance that really concerned the elites of Virginia society. And in fact, they were so concerned that after Bacon's Rebellion was put down, a series of laws were passed which made it very clear that there were different penalties in Virginia for whites and blacks. Which provided different restrictions depending upon whether you were white or black, and generally made it more difficult for interracial alliances to be established.</p>\n\n<p>This was done to send a message to whites and blacks - that there are fewer and fewer bases, fewer and fewer grounds upon which interracial relations and interracial alliances can be formed. But throughout the 18th century you find examples of blacks and whites who come together in common concern and in common action.</p>\n\n<p>In 1712 there was an incident in New York that was termed The Slave Conspiracy - but there were American Indians and white Americans who were executed for participating in that conspiracy. All those pre-Revolutionary mobs - the Stamp Act mob, certainly we know about the mob at the Boston massacre in 1770 - all those so-called mobs were also interracial coalitions because blacks and whites found themselves in very similar economic positions and they joined together to protest the ways in which they were being oppressed economically.</p>\n\n<p>From the standpoint of blacks and whites at the lower end of the colonial scale, there was every reason to work together to protest laws and measures that put them at an economic disadvantage and oppressed them economically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why was American slavery different?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's important to realize that slavery is not an American invention. Slavery is as old as recorded human society. In fact, we realize that the English word \"slave,\" comes from the word \"Slav,\" and it was applied to those people in eastern Europe who were bound and brought to the Mediterranean where they grew sugar. The fact is that slavery is a very old institution - there was slavery in various parts of Europe, and in various parts of Africa.</p>\n\n<p>But the thing that makes American slavery so distinctive is it is based on race. America's slavery is justified not, for example, as West African slavery is justified - where people were captured in battle and then held in a kind of captivity.</p>\n\n<p>Think about that for a second. Any of us could have lost that battle. Any of us could have been held in captivity. Any of us could have been a slave. But when you base slavery on the question of race, then if one of us is black and one is white and slavery is linked to blackness, then one of us could never have been a slave.</p>\n\n<p>And it is that kind of special category of human bondage that American falls into which makes it so distinctive, and in some ways as we look back in history, that is one of the things that has made it so destructive in terms of relationships within American society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between slavery and freedom?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In today's society, you know, the biggest problem we face is not slavery - slavery was abolished in 1865, more than 100 years ago. Instead, we face the problem of the rationalization of slavery in a nation built on freedom. In the 18th century, when we were trying to say to the world that we believed that God gave people certain rights that Man could not deprive them of - which is what it says in The Declaration of Independence - we were trying to say to the world that we were a new kind of country, the kind of country and the kind of people that stand up for the rights of the individual. Now when you are trying to make that kind of connection with the world, and you are also, by the way, a nation in which slaves provide the foundation of your economy, you've got to do some pretty fancy footwork in order not to seem what you in fact are. A hypocrite.</p>\n\n<p>And the way you do that is to say, \"Yeah, but you know, there is something different about these people. This whole business of inalienable rights is fine, but it only applies to certain people.\" And so from that moment on - from the moment when you start to recognize the necessity of trying to justify slavery in the land of freedom - you start to build a case that is specifically geared to tell the world that these people are different. And theories of race are used to do that. So now you don't have to feel at all like a hypocrite, because you are making the case that these people are different: They don't have the same rights. In fact, they can't handle those rights. In fact, holding them in slavery is really doing them a favor.</p>\n\n<p>So you build this notion over generations and then when slavery is over, the notion still lingers. In some ways, it would have been better if America had just looked the world in the eye and said, \"Look, we hold these people in slavery because we need their labor, and we have got the power to do it.\" That would have been much better because then when the power was gone when slavery was over, it is over.</p>\n\n<p>But what we said was, there is something different about these people - and by doing that, it means that when slavery is over, that rationalization for slavery remains. And it is that rationalization which takes on new incarnations in the late 19th and all through the 20th century. It is that rationalization which we now recognize as what we call American racism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does this rationalization take a toll?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thomas Jefferson is in many ways a personification of America. He is a person with a lofty ideals. He writes them down in the sacred document of American society, The Declaration of Independence. Those are the magic words of American society, wonderfully lofty aims and goals. But like America, Jefferson does not live up to his principles. He knows it. And he is bothered by it.</p>\n\n<p>He lives in a kind of anxiety actually between what he says and what he does. This is a person committed to human freedom who holds over 200 human beings in the state of slavery - and he knows that that is a massive contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>America is exactly the same way. I mean, we are a society based on principles literally to die for, principles that are so wonderful it brings tears to your eyes. But we are also a society that so often has allowed itself not to live by those principles, to ignore those principles. And we are conflicted by that.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a kind of heightened state of anxiety because we know we aren't what we could be or what we say we are. Race is at the center of both those dilemmas. That is the dilemma of Jefferson and the more basic dilemma of United States of America.</p>\n\n<p>That is also what America has to face - that is the most destructive part of the American experience, the fact that racism has come down to us. And it continues to divide us, it continues to makes it difficult for us to be the kind of nation that we really want to be, and we ought to be. And that racism came into existence to justify an institution which should never have been a part of America's history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How were racial identities influenced by conditions in America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you had interviewed the first slave to get off the first slave ship in Jamestown, there was no way that that person would have said to you, \"I am from Africa.\" He would have identified instead a nation, an ethnic group, a familial group, or a political group. He would have had something far more specific to say about his identity. It is only over a period of time that these people from a variety of backgrounds face a common oppression, find themselves in a common situation, and start to identify themselves first as Africans, but then as African Americans.</p>\n\n<p>So this process of becoming African American is an evolutionary process and it is determined in large degree by things that are happening in America. Just as becoming white is a process determined by conditions in America, becoming black or becoming African American is a result of a process, which is determined by conditions in American society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did race develop after the Constitution?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ironically race starts to become a much more important concept for dividing Americans during the time and immediately after the time of the establishment of the American Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution sets up this status of citizen. Now the concept of citizen is established and increasingly the citizen becomes a white person. Citizenship is increasingly race based. By the time we get to Jacksonian America - this is the America that we generally identify as the rise of the common man - by this time, it is the common white man.</p>\n\n<p>At this time, African Americans - many of whom have been voting in New York and in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania before this period - are actually losing the right to vote in these places or at least having that right to vote severely restricted. At the exact same time, property requirements - which early on limited the right of white people to vote if they didn't have a certain amount of property - are being abolished.</p>\n\n<p>So the irony is that as America is becoming more democratic for white males, it is also becoming increasingly race based, so that citizenship and the right to exercise the rights of a citizen, is becoming more and more determined by color. By the time we get to Jackson, who speaks out in a kind of populist way - speaking for the little guy, speaking out against privilege - his little guy, his citizen, is increasingly a white male citizen. By the time of Jacksonian America, race has become one of the most important dividers that exist in America.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does race become a major dividing line in the south?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race becomes a major defining feature of southern society at a time when slave holding is the central underpinning of the southern economy. But only 25 percent of white southerners hold slaves.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a question: How do you get the other 75 percent of non-slaveholding whites to support the institution of slavery? Well, one of the things you do is you make race - you make whiteness - the central feature and what you say is, although I am rich and you are poor, the thing we have in common, the thing that binds us together, the major feature of your life ought to be the fact that we are both white. So that you have more in common with a rich white person, you poor white person, than you do with a poor black person.</p>\n\n<p>And this is the way the south was held together in the pre-Civil War period, and it is the way the south has held together in the post-Civil War period. So that after slavery has ended - in fact, after slavery ends, it becomes even more important, because now there is a real possibility of free black people who are becoming independent farmers, some of them, to be joined with poor white farmers. In fact, by the end of the 19th century, there is this movement called the Populist Movement - which is a movement of poor farmers, black and white - against privilege, against economic oppression. This sends shock waves through the aristocratic society in the south. I mean, can you imagine if poor whites and poor blacks joined together around the fact that they are all being oppressed by the wealth and power of the southern region? And there is a major effort among these rich white southerners and business people who are doing great business, making great profit, by dealing with the southern society.</p>\n\n<p>It makes it incumbent upon them to emphasize the importance of race and so all through the late 19th century, all through the beginning of the 20th century, there is this constant message hammered at poor white people. You may be poor, you may have miserable lives right now, but the thing that is most important, the thing we want you to focus on is the fact that you are white. And that gives you opportunities for the future. It means that your children and your children's children might have opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>And if you can do this, if you can keep people at the bottom of society dividing because you define some as black and others as white, and you convince them that that divide is the central feature of their lives, then you in the upper regions of the economy can do quite well. And that is precisely what did happen in most of the 20th century south.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does it mean to say that race is a social construction?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race changes almost daily. Think about the late part of the 19th century, the early part of the 20th century when Jim Crow laws, basic segregation laws were being put on the books, when it was a crime to sit if you were black in a place other than in the back of the bus. You couldn't drink from water fountains unless that water fountain was marked \"For colored.\" When these things were written into law, the law had to go about the business of defining rights.</p>\n\n<p>And here is where it really gets interesting. You got some places, for example, Virginia - Virginia law defined a black person as a person with one sixteenth African ancestry. Now Florida defined a black person as a person with one eighth African ancestry. And Alabama said. \"You are black if you got any black ancestry, or any African ancestry at all.\" But you know what this means? You can walk across a state line and literally, legally, change race.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does race mean under those circumstances? You give me the power, I can make you any race I want you to be, because it is a social, political construction. It is not a matter of biology.</p>\n\n<p>But regardless of how ridiculous it is, the defining of race is tremendously important - economically, politically, legally in American society. Because once your race is defined, for most of the 20th century, it defines your opportunities. More than almost anything else it defines your life chances.</p>\n\n<p>Race is tremendously important in American society, although let me say again - it is not a matter of biology. It is a matter of social, political, legal construction.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"9f581c9d-e57e-46bd-b44d-427baf483f2e","name":"Founding Race: Race and Democracy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"5f13c4cd-25f4-4114-bf5f-bf3063cb9704","name":"Founding Race: Enslavement and Indian Removal","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Slavery","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Origin of the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/Race2/static/e3f5057598e4282d7625bcd78f0e26ba-46c6517c120b733ef8c2f9a0ce6c4eb3.png"}}}},{"title":"Africans, Slavery, and Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>With the hardening of slavery came the emergence of race.

Inequality is absolutely essential to the idea of race. The other part is that the behavior of people is very much part of their biology.</p>\n\n<p>And then the idea that all of this is inherited. People don't only inherit their biological features, but they also inherit their moral and temperamental and intellectual features. And it stays with us right into the 21st century. Not only are all of these features inherited, but they are not transcendable. You can't change. Racial populations, individual races, and individual people cannot change their race. So there's no way in which you can transcend this identity. Once you are identified as a socially low-status race, you remain so forever.</p>\n\n<p>Race wasn't invented because it is a set of beliefs and attitudes about human variation. It has nothing to do with the biological variation itself. You can have many societies with great diversity in physical features without the idea of race. Race represents attitudes and beliefs about human differences, not the differences themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did life in early colonial Virginia set the conditions for race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What's important to remember is that when the English established the colonies, they were motivated by greed. We don't talk about that very much in our history, that people are motivated by greed. But the earliest colonists came and took over whatever land they could get from the Indians. And by the 1620s or so, it was very clear they needed laborers to work that land. And that's when they established indentured servitude. Most of the indentured servants were Europeans, often Irish, Scots, English. Sometimes they were people who were captured in wars with the Irish - a phenomenon again that we also don't talk about very much. But the very first slaves that the English made in the Caribbean were Irish. And there were more Irish slaves in the middle of the 17th century than any others.</p>\n\n<p>But there was really no such thing as race then. The idea of race had not been invented. Although \"race\" was used as a categorizing term in the English language, like \"type\" or \"sort\" or \"kind,\" it did not refer to human beings as groups.</p>\n\n<p>And what's important to understand is that the laborers and the poor fraternized together. They socialized together. They worked together, they played together, they drank together, they slept together, they lived together. The first mulatto child was born in 1620 [one year after the arrival of the first Africans]. When you read descriptions of the period you get the picture that color doesn't make much difference, physical features don't make much difference to these people, because they were all in the same boat. They saw themselves as having in common how they were related to the planters, the big owners. Servants were subjected to all sorts of cruel forms of punishment. They ran away together when they were unhappy about their situation.</p>\n\n<p>Some Africans who got their freedom were able to buy land. They were able to establish themselves in a homestead, engage in trade and other activities with white farmers. They lent money to their white neighbors, for example, and they were involved in court cases. And this is where you see the equality clearly. Those Africans don't seem to be treated different from the white planters and other landowners. Once a person has land, then you have status.</p>\n\n<p>But at first, there weren't many opportunities for anyone to move up the ladder. The first indentured servants who came into the Americas, half of them died. They died before they served their 4 to 7 years' period of indenture. Others didn't get much land when they became free, or they didn't get tools with which to make a living. It was a devastating situation for a lot of people. The poor remained poor, essentially. And that's why you see these rebellions occurring. By the time you get into the 1660s people are showing a great deal of dissatisfaction with their circumstances. Bacon's Rebellion would never have occurred had it not been for the fact that the poor were treated so badly.</p>\n\n<p>It was not until late in the 17th century that you see the colonial leaders start separating out the Africans from the other servants. Mind you, the masses of people in those colonies were all poor. In fact, this may be at the base of some of the changes that took place in the late 17th century. The colony leaders, the big planters who owned most of the land, were often afraid that the poor would get together - poor blacks and whites and mulattos by this time. And there were several rebellions before Bacon. But the most important one was Bacon's Rebellion. That was 1676. Bacon's Rebellion was one catalyst that caused the leaders of the colonies to try to separate the poor and keep them from being united.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why were Africans the slaves of choice?</strong></p>\n\n<p>By 1680, you see the beginning of the changes. What had happened - and this is a complicated story - was that colonial leaders had to deal with Bacon and that rebellion. The British sent a fleet of three ships and by the time they got to Virginia, there were 8,000 poor men rebelling who had burned down Jamestown - blacks, whites, mulattos. And it was quite clear that this kind of unity and solidarity among the poor was dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>After that, they began to pass laws, very gradually. They passed laws that gave Europeans privileges while they increasingly enslaved Africans. They passed a number of laws that prevented blacks, Indians, and mulattos from owning firearms, for example. Everybody had firearms. Everybody in Virginia still has firearms!</p>\n\n<p>Then there was another change: There was a decline in the number of European servants coming to the New World. At the same time, there was an increase in the ships bringing Africans to the New World. By the 1690s or so, the English themselves had outfitted their ships to bring Africans back from the continent, and this is the first time that they had had direct connections.</p>\n\n<p>But the Africans also had something else. They had skills which neither the Indians nor the Irish had. The Africans brought here were farmers. They knew how to farm semi-tropical crops. They knew how to build houses. They were brick makers, for example. They were carpenters and calabash carvers and rope makers and leather workers. They were metal workers. They were people who knew how to smelt ore and get iron out of it. They had so many skills that we don't often recognize. But the colony leaders certainly recognized that. And they certainly gave high value to those slaves who had those skills.</p>\n\n<p>After 1690 things begin to change. All of the Europeans become identified as \"white.\" And Africans take on a different kind of identity. They are not only heathens, but they are people who are perceived as vulnerable to being enslaved. And that's a major point. Africans were vulnerable because it became part of the consciousness that they had no rights as Englishmen. Even the poorest Englishman knew that he had some rights. But once a planter owns a few Africans, the idea that the Africans had no rights that they had to recognize became very clear. And that's why they were vulnerable to being enslaved, and kept in slavery. The laws that were passed after that all tended to diminish the rights of African people. But between 1690 and 1735, even those Africans who had been free and who had been there for many generations, had their rights taken away from them.</p>\n\n<p>Once you magnify the difference between the slaves and the free, then it was possible to create a society in which the slaves were little better than animals. They were thought of as animals. And the more you think of slaves as animals, the more you justify keeping them as slaves.</p>\n\n<p>After a while, slavery became identified with Africans. Blackness and slavery went together in the popular mind. And this is why we can say that race is a product of the popular mind, because it was this consciousness that blackness and slavery were bound together, that gave people the idea that Africans were a different kind of people.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the early 17th century planter who wrote to the trustees of his company and he said, \"Please don't send us any more Irishmen. Send us some Africans, because the Africans are civilized and the Irish are not.\" But 100 years later, the Africans become increasingly brutalized. They become increasingly homogenized into a category called \"savages.\" And all the attributes of savagery which the English had once given to the Irish, now they are giving to the Africans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do the revolutionary ideas of liberty and the rights of man also harden ideas of race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the things we have to recognize is that slavery existed virtually everywhere. It existed throughout the Mediterranean, for example. Slavery was thousands of years old by the time the colonists in America established slavery. There was no need to justify slavery because the Spanish had slaves; the Portuguese had slaves. In other words, slavery was part of the normal state of affairs of the colonizing nations. It was part of their world.</p>\n\n<p>But this was a time when the English themselves were expanding their own sense of freedom. Their ideas about liberty and equality and justice were part of the Enlightenment period that the English went through. That's the period from about 1690 to 1790. And even the poorest Englishman knew he had rights, which is part of that Enlightenment philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>So the problem then became how to justify slavery, especially as the anti-slavery movement got started. At first it was heathenism. You could say, \"Well, yeah. We could keep these people enslaved because they were heathens.\" But then, many slaves began to convert to Christianity. So what do you do with slaves who are now Christians and presumably have souls?</p>\n\n<p>During the Revolutionary period you get the birth of these new ideas of equality, fraternity and the American Revolution and the French Revolution. And opposition to slavery grows. In the light of this opposition to slavery, the pro-slavery people, especially those big planters who owned hundreds of slaves, they really had to find a way of justifying and rationalizing what slavery was all about, to those people who mattered to them.</p>\n\n<p>Jefferson's statement in Notes on the State of Virginia is seen by many historians as not only the major statement about black inferiority, but as the first statement that really propels the colonies into trying to justify slavery. Jefferson actually says he's not sure but hazards the guess that Africans are naturally inferior. But, he says, \"We will not be able to know this until science gives us the answers.\" And so he calls on science to examine human populations and determine that blacks are naturally inferior. And that's exactly what science does. Within a generation after Jefferson writes this, scholars are writing about the natural inferiority of Africans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does early 19th century science fit into the picture?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The whole idea of racial science at that time was largely to search for differences between blacks and whites and Indians. But science didn't make race. Race was already part of popular culture because it's the way our society was stratified. Science only came in after Jefferson called upon science to come and confirm the idea of race. It helped to justify the treatment of Africans and Indians.</p>\n\n<p>From the beginning of the 19th century, you find a number of scientists, who begin to look for differences between racial populations. Most important was Dr. Samuel Morton, who in 1839 and 1845, produced a couple of major books that wouldn't have been read by the people at large, but were read by other scholars. And in these books he argues that there are physical differences that can be measured; there are differences in the brains of different populations who are called races.</p>\n\n<p>By the time you get to Morton and then later Louis Agassiz and a number of other people, they are arguing that blacks are not only inferior but they're a separate species altogether; that they were not created by God at the same time as other human beings, but they were a lower form of human - which is a fascinating kind of thing when you think about it. Coming from the 17th century, where Africans were at least considered civilized by some people, and now in the 19th century, Africans are not only considered not civilized, but they're considered a separate species from other human beings? It's a remarkable transformation in thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Samuel Morton do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the 1820s and '30s, a physician by the name of Samuel Morton, who lived in Philadelphia, began to collect skulls. And he collected skulls from populations around the world, and began to measure the internal capacities of these skulls. He devised a mechanism for using mustard seed and other materials to measure the internal capacity. He discovered that African skulls were smaller on average than European skulls, and that different populations had different average measurements in their skulls. This provided confirmation of the belief that Africans were less intelligent than other people.</p>\n\n<p>It was assumed, both by the population at large and by scientists, that people with larger heads and larger brains presumably were more intelligent than people with smaller ones. We now know that this isn't true. There are many people who have small skulls who are highly intelligent. But the fact is that there was a need to have scientific confirmation of the existence of races. And since races had to be different from one another, one of the ways of measuring these differences was essentially to say that the average skull size of races were different.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it's clear that Morton didn't always use similar skulls for comparative purposes. For example, he had some populations such as Indian populations, that were overrepresented by only female skulls. And female skulls are smaller, on average, than male skulls. That's because females are on average smaller in stature than males. Of course, intelligence has nothing to do with brain size.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who were some of the other ethnologists of the period?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After Morton, there were many other significant and well known scholars in America. One of these was Josiah Nott, who was a physician from Mobile, Alabama, who had studied with Morton. Josiah Nott had some really strange beliefs. He believed, for example, that blacks and whites should not intermarry, and that their progeny (that is, the children of such intermarriages) were abnormal. He also believed that different races were different species.</p>\n\n<p>Nott was the author, or editor actually, of a book called Types of Mankind, that was published, interestingly enough, in 1854, the year the Republican anti-slavery party was formed. You see this constant development of scientific confirmation of races as more and more anti-slavery institutions come into being, as the influence of the anti-slavery forces grows. The argument that the pro-slavery people used was to increasingly demonize and dehumanize the people who were slaves.</p>\n\n<p>Types of Mankind went through nine editions before the end of the century. It was widely read. But even people who were not literate knew what the findings were. And the findings demonstrated, or at least supposedly confirmed, that Africans were naturally inferior and they should be kept in slavery. They could not function independently of slavery. That's the whole gist of the Types of Mankind.</p>\n\n<p>Louis Agassiz became convinced by Morton that Africans were a separate species. And once he became part of Morton's clique, he became the most active spokesman for separate creations of the races. Agassiz came to the Americas from Switzerland. He came to Harvard. He became part of the upper crust society in Cambridge. He was Harvard's most prominent professor. He founded the Museum of Paleontology. He founded all of the biological sciences at Harvard. He was touted as a great man. He gave lectures all over the place. But most importantly, he trained the next generation of scientists in America. And these scientists spread out over America teaching the same kinds of attitudes about racial differences to other people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should white people care about this history?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think all Americans have to recognize that what has happened to African Americans and to Indian Americans and other people is a terrible thing that has to be righted. It has to be transformed. We have to transform our society and allow everybody to have equal rights and equal access to opportunity and equal education.</p>\n\n<p>But the whole history of racism has been, especially after the Civil War, one in which the popular majority has felt that blacks should occupy the lowest rung of the ladder. They were prevented from getting an education. They were prevented from acquiring land and other forms of property. And all of these terrible forms of repression had a major impact on the way African Americans realize their lives today.</p>\n\n<p>After the Civil War, black Americans had hoped that they would achieve some degree of success and become just like other people. And this is expressed in their writings. They expected to have opportunities, to be equal to other people. But that didn't turn out. And so the next generations were people couldn't acquire the education to develop themselves, they weren't allowed to acquire skills. The vast majority of white Americans are descendants of immigrants who came here in the 1890s and afterwards. They're not original Americans in that sense. But they were allowed to have access to skills, to jobs, to opportunities which black Americans were denied.</p>\n\n<p>If you give up racism, you're not giving up privileges. What you're doing is expanding privileges. You're not giving up your rights. You're not losing anything. What you would be doing is gaining something. White Americans don't realize how much has been lost by their failure to integrate blacks into the community.

It was a matter of creating hierarchies. Race was about a racist system of supremacy in which one group dominated the other. And I think that when we look at the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries the key moment where race becomes congealed as a system is where we can see the creation of a color line.</p>\n\n<p>Race, or the creation of racism, was really about the invention of a dominant group. In this case the dominant group were the slave owners - the dominant group were those who conquered the world - the Spanish, Portuguese and English. And here you get the emergence of this idea of a white race, you know a kind of pan-European white race. On the other side of that color line are all these different groups: indigenous peoples, Native Americans, Africans, Asians, who then get marked as something different and combined.</p>\n\n<p>So in India for example, in the 19th century, or 18th century, the Indians would be considered black in some ways by the British. They are not exactly the same as the Africans, they wouldn't be conceived the same way, but they ultimately would be placed on the other side of the color line. And so that is where the binary begins.</p>\n\n<p>Native Americans in North America for example, were the enemy. They were the Other - the ones who had to be conquered in order for Manifest Destiny to expand across North America. And they end up being lumped together with Africans, with Asians. So I guess what I am saying is that even within the categories of non-whiteness, you may have all these multiplicities, all these specific groups. But they still get lumped together as one, that is \"nonwhite.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was unique about the situation in North America that led to race as we know it today?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well it is an interesting question because you can go back to Ancient Greece and you can see the development of categories and hierarchies where the ancient Greeks may think of the Persians as barbarians.</p>\n\n<p>But something changed in the 17th and 18th centuries. And in some ways the creation of these new racial hierarchies were tied directly to the emergence of a New World economy. It's tied directly to the creation of a world system of slavery, the enslavement of Indian populations in Mexico, and the enslavement of Africans in Brazil and North America. You have a moment historically when Europe is expanding across the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Yet that expansion of Europe is also tied to a moment when all of Europe is inspired by democratic revolution, inspired by the Enlightenment. The potential for a world where, at last theoretically, everyone is equal and free - where liberty is the catch word of the day.</p>\n\n<p>The problem that they had to figure out is, how can we promote liberty, freedom, democracy on the one hand, and a system of slavery and exploitation of people who are non-white on the other? How can we do this?</p>\n\n<p>Remember, initially in the early stages of colonial America a lot of those poor whites and indentured servants who worked alongside Africans on early plantations and farms in North America, they rebelled together. Sometimes they took to arms such as in Bacon's Rebellion, sometimes they formed Maroon societies in which Native Americans and Africans and renegade whites ran away together and formed colonies to defend themselves against slave masters.</p>\n\n<p>But ultimately the way for the planter elite to undermine that potential unity among the renegade whites and the Africans and Native Americans was to begin to pass laws which created a very strict racial hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>The first set of laws were laws that made African slavery permanent. In other words you were property until death. They distinguished that kind of permanent slavery from indentured servitude, which was a limited amount of years and after that you are free.</p>\n\n<p>Other laws were passed against interracial marriage. Interracial marriage and interracial relationships had been fairly common in the early part of the 16th and 17th centuries. By the late 17th and early 18th century a lot of that stuff was outlawed. There were laws passed which promoted harsher punishment for Africans for crimes versus white Christians.</p>\n\n<p>And that in some ways helped destroy any potential for unity across those color lines and made the line sharper between black and, white, or white and other.</p>\n\n<p>And here you get the formation of a really foundational system of racism which was necessary in order for America to become both a democracy on one hand and a slave state on the other.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, another problem is that the way liberty really gets translated in real life is the right to own property. And if you have liberty rooted in the right to own property, that includes the right to own slaves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did early American peoples see themselves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind in this early period of 17th century America is that blackness and whiteness weren't clear categories of identity. When Africans came here they came to the New World not as black people, not as Negroes. They didn't see themselves that way. They saw themselves according to their own sort of ethnic identities. The same with the Europeans. They were Portuguese, they were English, and Irish.</p>\n\n<p>So you have a situation in which alliances are formed on these new plantation economies and in the new town of the New World in which sometimes being Irish was close to being Ibo. Sometimes people met together in taverns and bars who were considered sort of riff-raff, the lower classes, and they were a mix of different people across racial lines.</p>\n\n<p>Over time those alliances were broken up, and as the alliances were broken up, it became clear that many of the European-descended poor whites began to identify themselves with, if not directly with the rich whites, certainly with being white. As a way to distinguish themselves from those dark-skinned people who they associate with perpetual slavery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To what extent do we make our own racial self-identities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between racial identity imposed upon people like a marker, like a brand, versus a self-formed identity. And of course these things are connected but there is a distinction.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of black people you could see the evolution in how they saw themselves from their own ethnic identities to a pan-African identity, to maybe seeing themselves as part of a larger solidarity with other people from the African continent.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you look at the history of black naming of the 19th century you have names like African, Afro-Saxon, Anglo-African, colored, free people of color, Negro, and each one of these self-named identities are saying something about the relationship to the larger world.</p>\n\n<p>And when black people early in the 19th century stopped calling themselves African and began calling themselves Negro or colored American, it was to make claims upon citizenship. It was to say look, you want to send us back to Africa, and even though we may feel ourselves of African descent, we want to claim American-ness, claim \"colored American,\" claim \"Negro,\" in order to support our claims to being in this country.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing with Asian identities. In the 19th century you don't see people self-identifying as Asian because they were tied to very specific nationalities. A pan-Asian identity is a modern thing. It is a modern 20th-century notion which is intended to build solidarity against racism and for a broader pan-Asian culture - a new kind of culture in some ways.</p>\n\n<p>And that is why we can never talk about identities as fixed, they are always dynamic and changing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To what extent is racial self-identity a negotiation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My whole life is a personal experience about understanding racism. Every day as a black person in this country I am reminded that I am black. But interestingly, this is a world where even the definition of blackness is multiple and complex, so I get these questions: \"Are you Puerto Rican?\" \"Are you Dominican?\" \"You must not be from the United States.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you don't talk like those southern Negroes.\" There is a whole range of ways in which blackness gets marked. The same with whiteness.</p>\n\n<p>And so I think that one of the things that young people need to always realize is race is this dynamic process of identity formation and reformation where the identities that you cling to are made within the context of other people making identities and imposing them on you.</p>\n\n<p>And so sometimes just the resistance to someone else's identity imposed on you itself becomes a new identity. And that is why so much of anti-racism in America is about overthrowing stereotypes but also finding ways to celebrate what is distinct and unique about us as a community. No matter what that community is.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it is about building communities that didn't exist before. You know, there is no necessary reason why people from North Africa and Morocco, or the Gnawa people of Morocco or the people of the Congo should necessarily be united as one community. Yet it is precisely racism that produced the circumstances for that basis of unity. But there is also more than that. It is also the recognition that there are certain cultural elements that we share as a community, certain values that we share as a community, which lay the foundation for new identities.</p>\n\n<p>And that is what is so tricky about it. When you see those new racial identities you have young people who say that that itself is a racism. And I think that is a mistake. It is a mistake to argue that in the context in which we live that we can't form new identities because I think the dream that everyone has is a moment in which we not only recognize the dynamism of identities but we can all see ourselves not as one group, but as multiple groups that can share and exchange ideas from one another so that we can always be changing, and always become something different and yet never lose the sense of difference and community and individuality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does the one-drop rule develop in North America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>North America is unique because it had this one-drop rule. That is, is if you have any African ancestors that makes you black. And of course it is not the same in every state. And it is unlike the Caribbean or Brazil or other places.</p>\n\n<p>Now why is this the case in North America? That is the question. In part, it's because every slave society had to have a buffer class. In the Caribbean, which had a 90 -95% African-descended population, that buffer class was the mulatto group.</p>\n\n<p>In North America you had a buffer class of poor whites. And as long as you had that continual immigration of poor whites, white working-class people in North America with limited privileges, that class that would always oppose these Africans.</p>\n\n<p>And so therefore every single person of African descent in a multiracial culture like North America would be considered not only black, but would be considered potential slaves. In a system where slavery is generational, the offspring of interracial relationships could then be enslaved and so the slavemaster wouldn't lose his property.</p>\n\n<p>And even if they were free they would have limited access to citizenship and democracy. So laws were passed that limited their movement or access to rights and privileges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Enlightenment science affirm ideas of race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another reason why the context of the Enlightenment is so important to race is because this is when the idea of science is being invented. And what ends up happening is that science becomes a challenge to Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>Biblical ideas basically suggest that everyone evolved from Adam and Eve. And if that is the case, the only way to explain 'racial' difference is the climate - that old idea that a temperate climates produce superior people and that hot climates produce dim-witted people but for different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>What is interesting is that the Enlightenment produced a challenge to Christianity. And what ends up happening is scientists begin to talk about the races as separate human species emerging over time.</p>\n\n<p>And when you can talk about different species, it solves the problem of saying that we are all part of the Christian world. It allows you to begin to designate some people as just one step out of the animal kingdom, in the case of Africans. It even allows you in some ways to talk about the noble savage in the case of Native Americans, who are celebrated in some ways initially as having a certain kind of superior primitive knowledge that could be liberating for the West.</p>\n\n<p>Now what is also interesting is that science in the 18th and 19th century requires a rewriting of the histories that they already knew in order to justify these claims. Perhaps the best example is that in the 19th century, ancient history gets rewritten so that the connection of Egypt and North Africa to ancient Greece gets erased. Almost all historians who write histories of the formation of Europe and Greek lineage begin to literally, systematically remove the present of Egyptian philosophers.</p>\n\n<p>And of course we think of this as a small deal. But it is a huge deal in terms of the way that these new regimes could justify the idea that Africans are perpetually, intrinsically and inherently inferior to this new group we call Europeans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why didn't we do away with racism after slavery?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Post-Civil War Reconstruction represents one of those moments when I think racism might have been overthrown - one of those roads not quite taken.</p>\n\n<p>After Emancipation, all these freed African Americans began to build institutions and homes and communities. At the end of the Civil War, the first task was to reconstruct the South, to reconstruct democracy. The Republican Party consisted of some poor southern whites, African Americans, and northern radicals who were committed to a new democracy. And together they passed laws and produced a vision of society in which everyone would have a right to land, everyone would have the right to free universal public education, everyone - at least all males - would have the right to vote. And as a result of Reconstruction, many poor whites who couldn't vote before were able to vote. As a result of Reconstruction and the leadership of these ex-slaves, many poor whites who never had access to public schools suddenly got to go to school.</p>\n\n<p>That was a moment when the frame of racism could have been broken and it didn't happen. It didn't happen precisely because many of those same poor whites, who were enjoying the fruits of democracy for the first time, ended up choosing their skin color over their class - and that was one of the biggest tragedies in American history.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways there is a parallel between the period of Reconstruction and what we think of as the modern Civil Rights Movement. And in both of those periods there were whites who were inspired by the black freedom struggle, who saw the potential for a new society rooted in the destruction of racism - a society that would benefit themselves and benefit all of humanity.</p>\n\n<p>In the Civil Rights Movement there were many poor people who in fact were inspired by the demands of the Student Nonviolent Coordinated Committee, who were inspired by the demands for economic justice.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it is not an accident that the tail end of that Civil Rights Movement put economic justice at the forefront, much like during Reconstruction when economic justice became a critical issue. But once again, in both of those moments, many of the whites who could benefit from the struggle for economic justice decided that it didn't make sense to make an alliance with black people and again they chose race over class. Which was again, a big tragedy for America.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Isn't racism just a form of ignorance and fear?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I teach about racism the first thing I say to my students is that racism is not ignorance. Racism is knowledge. Racism in some ways is a very complicated system of knowledge, where science, religion, philosophy, are used to justify inequality and hierarchy. That is foundational. Racism is not simply a kind of visceral feeling you have when you see someone who is different from you.</p>\n\n<p>Because in fact if you look at the history of the world there are many people who look different who are seen as both attractive and unattractive. It is not about how you look, it is about how people assign meaning to how you look. And that is learned behavior, you see.</p>\n\n<p>And that is why you can't think of racism as simply 'not knowing.' That is not the case at all - on the contrary.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e2b3298a-a33d-4bc3-94b3-0c9a63f7a7c2","name":"Making Whiteness: Whiteness and Class","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}},{"id":"9f581c9d-e57e-46bd-b44d-427baf483f2e","name":"Founding Race: Race and Democracy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Hierarchy","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"White Supremacy","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"The Hispanic Color Divide","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>John R.
