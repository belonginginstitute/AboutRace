Early white planters needed labor. The first African brought to British North America came to Jamestown. Jamestown had been through a series of what were called \"starving times\" where substantial numbers of people died. They needed labor. They had stumbled upon this crop. They'd been looking for gold forever and discovered there wasn't a whole lot of gold in Virginia, but the closest they could find to gold was tobacco. But they needed labor to grow tobacco, and that tobacco became the support of the colony. Africans were available to provide the labor. They had the skill, by the way, to provide the labor. Therefore, the economic necessity of the time made it easy for those in Virginia and later those in all parts of the colonies, to kid themselves that in some way they were doing something that was not objectionable, that could be rationalized. In a word, we're talking avarice.</p>\n\n<p>For the generations that came afterward and maybe didn't have land or didn't need the labor, it served a different function. One of the things that our concept of race has done is to say to white people at the bottom of American society, you can only fall so far, because race provides a floor beneath which no white person can ever fall. Below this floor there are black people. This is why, for example, non-slaveholders could be convinced by slaveholders to support the Civil War. Because non-slaveholders were told that by supporting the institution of slavery and making sure that institution continues to exist, you can continue to protect yourself from falling to the bottom of southern society, where you will share positions with black people at the bottom of society. So one of the things that racism does is it works to the advantage of those people who are not wealthy and who are not politically, economically strong enough to keep themselves from the lower regions of America's social, political, economic system by, again, providing a floor below which no white person can ever fall. It's a racial floor in American society.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think the use of the term \"ideology\" in the question caught my attention, because I don't think it's precisely the same blatant racist ideology of inherent innate inferiority based on the genes. It doesn't have the power that it once did in the sense that, you know, it's no longer respectable. It used to be what educated white people believed, but now it's been discredited as a scientific doctrine. But racism survives in a somewhat altered ideological form. It still exists in subtle and implicit forms, certainly associated with stereotypes. And many of the same stereotypes and some new stereotypes operate. In fact, sometimes now the way we justify existing inequalities by saying, \"Oh, we have a colorblind society where there's no legal differences between the races and therefore if blacks are falling behind, or have fallen behind or have not caught up, it must be their own fault.\" People won't admit that it's akin to old-fashioned racism. \"They're not inherently inferior, but there's something wrong with their culture or their character that prevents them from being competitive and there's nothing we can do about that, because we now have a colorblind society.\" That's the new form that racism is taking, and some people actually call it \"colorblind racism.\" Where the old racism was color-coded, overtly, this is supposed to be colorblind.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>I'd like to add that there's a whole new phenomenon we find especially in the African American studies literature, which is that it's the culture of these people that determines why they can't make it or what happens to them in our society: \"We're not holding people back as individuals, but if they come from this kind of a culture where they're not used to discipline and where they're not used to working hard and so forth, then you know, they have to change their culture.\" And this has become an insidious argument now. Essentially what racism has done is to create a society in which the vast majority of black people were held to low-status jobs and were not able to get the kind of education that whites have and so forth, and now they're blaming their behavior on the fact that they come out of these kinds of cultures.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-why-was-a-racist-ideology-so-easy-for-white-america-f07","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhyWasARacistIdeologySoEasyForWhiteAmerica","path":"/qa/why-was-a-racist-ideology-so-easy-for-white-america","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"00b421df-45e5-40f2-8153-ce39922b40dd"},"updatedAt":1531342933078,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"00b421df-45e5-40f2-8153-ce39922b40dd"}}
