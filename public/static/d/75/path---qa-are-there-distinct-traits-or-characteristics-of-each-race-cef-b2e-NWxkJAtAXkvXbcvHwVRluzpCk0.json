Can't you look at overall genetic patterns and estimate of what somebody's race is?"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>Basically with enough variables, one can divide almost any sample into subsamples. An example of this is that with a few skull measurements, one can do a pretty good job of separating skulls of 18th-century white Americans from 19th-century white Americans. You can't do it with a single variable, of course, but with a combination of variables, statistically, with more and more variables you'll do better and better and better in dividing individuals into the groups in which they're purported to belong. But that doesn't mean that those groups have any sort of underlying biological integrity, or any sort of underlying real integrity. It's just a matter of statistics. And it doesn't necessarily produce a sorting that we can all agree upon. Variation is always, to some degree, random.</p>\n\n<p>The question, though, is really about race as a scientific or analytical category. It doesn't work as such, for a number of reasons. For one, definitions of race are always based on social definitions. They are socially defined, and thus entirely fluid and unstable, and they vary from time to time and place to place. Secondly, on the biological side, we've all come to realize the incredible amount of variation within any so-called race. So the greater the amount of variation within, the greater the number of variables that you're going to need to define a race. But why even begin to go down that road when there really is no underlying analytical or biological reality in the idea of race in the first place. On a grand scale, I really can't find a reason to think that races would have any sort of reality to them, in terms of selection and evolution.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>One of the fascinating things that's come out of genetics in the last ten or fifteen years, is the discovery that human beings don't have much genetic variation. As Pilar was saying, we are apparently a young species. And if you compare the genetic diversity in a group of chimpanzees with the genetic diversity among humans all over the world, what you find is that chimpanzees are very much more diverse from one another than humans are, in spite of the fact that chimpanzees all look alike to us. And that's because they're a much older species. They've had a lot more time to differentiate.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in terms of the way this question is framed, we're eliding different uses of the term race. On the one hand we're talking about this classic, essentialized race where if you have one drop of non-white blood, you're in that non-white category. And now suddenly in this question, we're talking about average differences between mega-populations. And these are actually quite different conceptions.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"6c13da42-38df-44f6-9da3-42cc0652b1a3"}}
