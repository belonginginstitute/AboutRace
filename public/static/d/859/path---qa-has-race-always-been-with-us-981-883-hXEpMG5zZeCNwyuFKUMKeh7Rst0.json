After all, the Bible does say, \"God made of one blood all the races of the world.\" That passage has been used over and over again in the history of Christianity to resist extreme racism, to resist racism which would say that blacks or Jews lack souls to be saved. The universalist aspect of the Bible was used by abolitionists and it was used by advocates of civil rights. So the Bible can also be, and has been, a weapon for liberation and equality, and I think it can continue to be that.</p>"},"changed":1531506386}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Classification","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Scientific and Folk Ideas About Heredity","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>We make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/c51cd4ffaef17f2448fdce30f36ec797-bb1c2ef684bb0489a2511453032a3e2d.png"}}}},{"title":"Slavery, and the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/9ce2075939e2d48f0db2848fde0b0af5-9972893df12cce8eba77938c24d03308.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Has race always been with us?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>Today, historians and social scientists in the Western world have reached the conclusion that the concept of \"race\" is a modern idea; it did not exist before the 17th century and came into fruition gradually during the 18th century.
