Some studies ask where your grandparents were born, for instance. Such studies are really categorizing people according to ancestry, not race. Most studies now, if they're trying to group people by race, rely on recommendations from government agencies. The guidelines suggest that you first ask people a question about ethnicity - are you Hispanic or not Hispanic? - and then ask a question about race. So it's based on self-identification. Participants do have the opportunity to identify themselves as having more than one race, but researchers are supposed to be able to take whatever the research subjects say and collapse that back down into the administrative categories that the government uses, which are White, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black.</p>\n\n<p>This question raises the important point that scientists need to be very clear about who they are studying and why they are studying those particular people. Just because black and white Americans may have \"mixed\" ancestry, does not make all research that uses racial categories invalid. It depends on what the scientist is trying to study. Race is a very, very powerful social category in the U.S., it influences where we live, what schools we attend, what jobs we have, what kinds of stresses we experience, whether we have access to health care, and many other aspects of our lives. Because race is such a powerful social category, it can influence our biology and our health.

If we were trying to find an Asian ideal, we would exclude many people generally identified as Asian, and probably include some who are not so identified in everyday life. Historically, some societies have tried to define \"ideal\" or \"pure\" racial types - the Nazis attempted to do this in the mid-twentieth century, and the Spain of Torquemada did it in the fifteenth century. When a society expends many resources attempting to find an ideal racial type, it is usually so that it can discriminate against those who do not meet the ideal.</p>\n\n<p>The notion that there exist people who are purely of one race or another probably stems from the idea that at some time in history, groups of people were isolated on each continent, that these groups had children only with each other for many generations, and that these continentally isolated populations are reflected in our current human races. Subpopulations in other species are formed when a small group of individuals becomes an isolated breeding population for many generations, then the isolated group develops significant genetic dissimilarity to other populations of the same species. However, there is no evidence that human races were ever isolated breeding populations; people have always mingled with their neighbors, have always migrated and traded, and by having children together we traded genes as well as trinkets.</p>"},"changed":1531505403},{"title":"Are sickle cell and Tay-Sachs racial diseases?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>First of all, we need to say that being of a certain race is not what causes somebody to have the gene variant for Tay-Sachs, or the gene variant for sickle cell. It's having ancestors who were in a geographic region where those things either occurred by chance or were selected for, as in the sickle cell case. Although many people in the U.S. think sickle cell is a disease of black people, that's not necessarily true. Sickle cell is found in people in Greece, the island of Orchomenos, in particular, has very high carrier rates for sickle cell. There are also high carrier rates among people on the Arabian peninsula and people in India. There are parts of India where sickle cell carrier rate is as high as it is anywhere in Africa. On the other hand, people in the southern part of Africa - or people whose ancestry goes back to the southern part of Africa - don't have high sickle cell carrier rates because that allele is selected for only in human beings who have lived where there's a high incidence of malaria, which you don't find in southern Africa. People do not carry the sickle cell gene variant because they are of a certain race, but because of some more particularized population history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also think it's worth pointing out that, while we make claims about the sickle cell carrier rate in black people and white people in the U.S., if you were to go to a period of our history where we defined black and white differently, then those numbers would be different.

But that's not true everywhere, and it's not even necessarily true at all times in the United States.
