In other words, can ancient conflicts like between the Irish and the English be described as racial?

That is a fundamentally extreme sense of ethnocentrism, just as the Hutu Tutsi example is. The latter was turned into a racial conflict by European colonists who interpreted this conflict as racial when it wasn't at all. We have to make a distinction between extreme ethnocentrism and racism.
