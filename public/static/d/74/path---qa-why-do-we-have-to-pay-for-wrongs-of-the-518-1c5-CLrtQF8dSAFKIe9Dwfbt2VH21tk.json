Is that right, and is that fair? The legacy of slavery and white supremacy is still with us. I'll give you an example that is very tied to affirmative action admissions. Many students of color do not have access to honors courses or AP courses in schools that are mostly serving whites. Why is that? What isn't talked about in the Michigan affirmative action case that's currently being decided by the Supreme Court, is that Michigan schools are the most segregated in the United States for African Americans, according to the Harvard Civil Rights Project. Therefore, students of color are not attending the schools with the high-level AP and honors courses for which the University of Michigan gives extra points. Yet no one really gets bent out of shape about those preferential points that clearly have a built-in racial advantage for whites and disadvantage African Americans. It's really irrelevant if you were a slaveholder or a slave, because society still perpetuates these inequalities today. The continuing effect from this historical legacy is one reason why affirmative action policies are important.</p>\n\n<p>David Freund:<br />\nEven in so-called integrated schools, minority kids are often tracked into classes whereas Sumi said, they're not going to get access to that kind of training and have those kinds of opportunities.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"David Freund"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>In a way, this question illustrates how many people bring their assumptions and conflate a lot of different issues all at once.

Every racial group is always linked to every other racial group. So when you talk about something like white privilege, you have to understand it's a system of inequality that relates groups together. That's a very important part of how institutional racism works: it perpetuates inequality in a way that most people who gain the advantage don't realize.
