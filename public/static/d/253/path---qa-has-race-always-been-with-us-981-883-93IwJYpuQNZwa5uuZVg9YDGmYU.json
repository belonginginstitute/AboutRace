In many parts of the world, those captured in battle were often enslaved. Anyone could be enslaved if they were on the losing side.

To avoid looking like a hypocrite, you come up with a story that says, \"There's something different about these people.

And it takes on new incarnations. The most destructive part of the American experience is the rationalization of this special category of human bondage.

Not only are laypersons confused, but scientists and doctors are also confused, and they make critical decisions based on what they think race is. The bottom line is that race was once thought to explain most human variation in genetics and biology. However, like the idea that the earth is flat, this notion of race has not stood the test of time. Human biological variation is remarkably complex and fascinating. It is best described in ways that capture this complexity. The idea of race, that humans are lumped into a finite number of groups, does not do the job. On the other hand, racializing and racisms have potentially dire health and medical consequences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThankfully, the old notion of race as inherent biology has been disproved, making it more apparent that racial differences in health must be due to myriad differences in life experience. We need to do an even better job of understanding how what we gloss as race relates to medical care and health.

Not only are laypersons confused, but scientists and doctors are also confused, and they make critical decisions based on what they think race is. The bottom line is that race was once thought to explain most human variation in genetics and biology. However, like the idea that the earth is flat, this notion of race has not stood the test of time. Human biological variation is remarkably complex and fascinating. It is best described in ways that capture this complexity. The idea of race, that humans are lumped into a finite number of groups, does not do the job.
