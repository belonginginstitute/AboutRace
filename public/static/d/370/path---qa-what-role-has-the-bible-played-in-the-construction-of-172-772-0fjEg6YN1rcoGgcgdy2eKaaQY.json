","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>What's distinctive about the American concept of race is that it's almost entirely based on color, and it comes largely out of the need to rationalize the irreconcilable contradiction that we talked about in an earlier question. That is, a contradiction between a belief in freedom, a kind of new Enlightenment ideal, and the maintenance of an institution of human bondage. In societies before, as Audrey mentioned, it was possible to hold a person in slavery because there was not the same kind of commitment to the principle of human liberty as we see demonstrated, for example, in the Declaration of Independence. Because people never argued for equality, you could have a variety of social inequalities without rationalization. But once you've got people who argue that people are equal in society, you've got to explain why inequalities still exist.

I don't like the expression because it sets the wrong terms for discussion when it comes to issues of race, equality, and social justice. To me, \"blind\" means not being able to see things, and wanting to be \"blind\" to color or race seems to mean wanting to ignore race or pretend its social and historical effects don't exist. When the larger question is how do we have an equitable society today, we have to be mindful of the historical and social complexities of race, not willfully ignore them.
