But racism is based on the assumption that race is an indicator of basic traits of character. That is, if you know a person's race, you can say a lot more than simply what race the person is. Presumably, you can say how the person might think, how the person might react, his inclination, his physical abilities, all those kinds of things. And of course, you can't do anything about your race. You are whatever race you are judged to be. Once society makes the construction, constructs race, you are a certain race depending upon certain physical, outwardly observable characteristics.

That is, a contradiction between a belief in freedom, a kind of new Enlightenment ideal, and the maintenance of an institution of human bondage. In societies before, as Audrey mentioned, it was possible to hold a person in slavery because there was not the same kind of commitment to the principle of human liberty as we see demonstrated, for example, in the Declaration of Independence.
