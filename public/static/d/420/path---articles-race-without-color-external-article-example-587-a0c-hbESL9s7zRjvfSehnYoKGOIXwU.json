For one, definitions of race are always based on social definitions. They are socially defined, and thus entirely fluid and unstable, and they vary from time to time and place to place. Secondly, on the biological side, we've all come to realize the incredible amount of variation within any so-called race. So the greater the amount of variation within, the greater the number of variables that you're going to need to define a race.

An example of this is that with a few skull measurements, one can do a pretty good job of separating skulls of 18th-century white Americans from 19th-century white Americans. You can't do it with a single variable, of course, but with a combination of variables, statistically, with more and more variables you'll do better and better and better in dividing individuals into the groups in which they're purported to belong. But that doesn't mean that those groups have any sort of underlying biological integrity, or any sort of underlying real integrity. It's just a matter of statistics. And it doesn't necessarily produce a sorting that we can all agree upon. Variation is always, to some degree, random.</p>\n\n<p>The question, though, is really about race as a scientific or analytical category. It doesn't work as such, for a number of reasons. For one, definitions of race are always based on social definitions. They are socially defined, and thus entirely fluid and unstable, and they vary from time to time and place to place.

Why would forensics investigators even want to determine a person's race? Because you're not trying to find a black or white or Asian. You're trying, most often, to find a person, so you're looking for unique markers, not ones that are generalizable to a group. Secondly, it kind of is a game in which you have to make, first, the assumption that there is such a thing as race.
