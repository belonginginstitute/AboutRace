There's legal support for this under the principle of restitution; that is, where someone profits from wrongdoing, principles of equity demand that the law disgorges those profits that are accumulated from this ill-gotten gain. We've seen it historically in this country with reparations for Japanese Americans for their wartime internment by the U.S. government, and we are seeing it also globally with regards to demands for reparations for victims of the Nazi slave labor policies during World War II. So I think the obvious question is why wouldn't it also be appropriate for African Americans in this country, as Randall Robinson and many others are arguing? Here you have a crime against humanity in which the government also participated and benefited - how can we not offer reparations?</p>\n\n<p>Robert Westley has dealt with most common concerns against reparations in hisÂ work: there's no causation, no causal link, the people have long since died, both perpetrators and victims, who should get it, etc. But he and many others in the reparations movement are thinking of communal ways to essentially pay reparations, to invest them in community institutions, as well as address the calls for individual payment.

To me, \"blind\" means not being able to see things, and wanting to be \"blind\" to color or race seems to mean wanting to ignore race or pretend its social and historical effects don't exist. When the larger question is how do we have an equitable society today, we have to be mindful of the historical and social complexities of race, not willfully ignore them. [Unless, of course, one believes that race doesn't have or hasn't had any impact, in which case there's no need for discussion.] We should strive to be color \"full\" rather than colorblind.<br /><br />\nThis doesn't mean, however, that we should divide people by race today. A central difficulty is the slipperiness of race and the many forms it's taken historically. To address the issue of race and equality, we must consider color in several different, seemingly contrary ways. The first is to recognize race's illusory status to avoid recapitulating racial categories and racial divides. The second is to acknowledge the real effect those categories have had and continue to have on peoples' lives and circumstances. And the third is to understand that racial divides, by their very nature, create imbalance and inequality.<br /><br />\nThese various shades of \"color\" must all be kept in perspective, none at the expense of the other, if we want to address seriously the question of how to be an equitable society today. There may not be a solution, but if there is one, it will almost certainly be difficult, and it will require effort, awareness, and responsibility. We can not afford to be \"colorblind.\" We need to develop our ability to see \"color\" for what is, has been, and will be, so we're prepared to deal with its consequences.</p>"},"changed":1531438957},{"title":"Are reparations for slavery appropriate?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>It would probably be useful to list some of the complications or arguments against reparations, simply because people may not be aware of what issues are involved.
