Each cell contains many copies, while there are only one or two copies of nuclear DNA. The other good thing about mitochondrial DNA is that it changes very rapidly, about ten times more rapidly than nuclear DNA does. And so, when you compare mitochondrial DNA sequences across individuals, you're far more likely to find differences than in a comparable length of nuclear DNA across a couple of people.</p>\n\n<p>Now the fact is that, not too many years ago it was thought that race was the major organizing principle of human diversity. And I think that it is very noteworthy to discover that when you start looking at pretty much any piece of DNA - the genetic patterns do not sort out racially.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you were to isolate the genes for hair form - which we have not isolated and we are nowhere close to isolating - but if you were to isolate those genes and look at their patterns, say, across the globe you might well find that they sort out in some sort of approximation to commonsense ideas about race.</p>\n\n<p>Well, first of all, you have to look very hard to find a piece of genetic data that would yield a racial pattern. Because the vast bulk of genetic data do not. And in the second place, you don't need genetics of hair form to sort people by hair form, you just look at their hair.</p>"},"changed":1532733777}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"377e9597-4682-4dd6-8c61-c037cb252488"}}
