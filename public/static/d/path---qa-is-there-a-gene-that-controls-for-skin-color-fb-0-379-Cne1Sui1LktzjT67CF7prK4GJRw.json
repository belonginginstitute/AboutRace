Why are there such striking visual differences between people, not just in terms of skin, but also nose shape, eye shape, etc. - how did those evolve and what makes us look so different?"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>There's probably not just one gene for skin color, but a variety of genes for skin color. Physical features such as nose shape and eye color, along with skin color, probably evolved in response to selective pressures from environment - high/low levels of radiation, heat, cold, etcetera. This is why, for example, you get tall thin people in hot climates and short, stocky people in cold areas. These are adaptive responses to the environment.</p>\n\n<p>In most cases we have some sense how different traits may have evolved. It seems quite likely that skin color is a response to solar radiation - in areas with more solar radiation, people typically have darker skin. Melanin, after all, protects against burns and skin cancer. On the other hand, light skin allows more solar radiation to get through, more vitamin D to be produced, and thus protects against things like rickets in areas of low solar radiation. So different climates produce different environmental pressures, resulting in a tendency towards light skin in some areas and darker skin in other areas. However, there's no real smoking gun here. We try to put together logical evolutionary explanations, but in the end, no one knows how these differences evolved.</p>\n\n<p>One thing we do know, though, is that to the extent that there are genes for these different physical features, they're not inherited together. The genes for skin color are inherited independently of the genes for nose shape, eye shape, eye color and hair texture.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-is-there-a-gene-that-controls-for-skin-color-fb0","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaIsThereAGeneThatControlsForSkinColor","path":"/qa/is-there-a-gene-that-controls-for-skin-color","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"377e9597-4682-4dd6-8c61-c037cb252488"},"updatedAt":1531344164112,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"377e9597-4682-4dd6-8c61-c037cb252488"}}
