How do we perpetuate racial inequalities or bias without realizing it?"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>The most concrete action that any one individual can take is to educate themselves about the ways that race and racism work and to see things in terms of social relations rather than discrete individual acts. Every racial group is always linked to every other racial group. So when you talk about something like white privilege, you have to understand it's a system of inequality that relates groups together. That's a very important part of how institutional racism works: it perpetuates inequality in a way that most people who gain the advantage don't realize. People need to understand these relationships and recognize that if we do the same thing we've always done, we're perpetuating inequality.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Dalton Conley"},"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-what-can-individuals-do-c4c","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhatCanIndividualsDo","path":"/qa/what-can-individuals-do","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"9ce84b50-27f3-4cf9-b10c-995b83e1a71b"},"updatedAt":1531342276283,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"9ce84b50-27f3-4cf9-b10c-995b83e1a71b"}}
