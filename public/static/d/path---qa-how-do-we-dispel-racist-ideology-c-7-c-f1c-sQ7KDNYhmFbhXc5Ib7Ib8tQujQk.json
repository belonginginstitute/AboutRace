There are still people who function as if the rationalization is based on truth. There are still people who feel, well, black people have certain kinds of characteristics that I can attribute to them simply because of their race - whether it's genetic or like George says, a product of culture, it's just the way they are.</p>\n\n<p>Now if we realize that all that is a rationalization, that these things happen to people after they're born, not before, that would help. Then we have to understand the destructive effect of that rationalization on the people against which it is directed and on the society as a whole. If we think about the extent to which this society is in need of a variety of talents and abilities, if we think about the extent to which the rationalization that was used to support slavery is now used in today's society to deny large numbers of people opportunities to contribute their talents to society, then we realize the society as a whole suffers because of that. Simply said, we need all the talents Americans can provide. If we make it impossible for all Americans to provide their talents, we're not only hurting those people who have the talents, we're also hurting the society that needs those talents.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>As an anthropologist, I think social change occurs very slowly. I can't even anticipate what might be the long-range outcome of affirmative action policy, but I think that things are changing regardless of affirmative action, although it helps us along. When you look at a Republican administration that has a Condoleezza Rice and a Colin Powell, you are looking at a phenomenon that most people probably don't recognize as having an impact on themselves or the rest of society. You are looking at a phenomenon that says it's okay to have competent black people in positions of power, as advisors to the President. Other events and people have also inspired subtle change that has not yet been recognized. For example, the Oprah show. The vast majority of people who look at Oprah Winfrey are white women, and they are experiencing a life-changing kind of experience, because they are seeing a black woman in a position where black women have never been before.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>I would add that changing stereotypes is only part of the issue. There's also institutional racism which operates to deny people opportunities, and which, as I said earlier, isn't about individual acts or personal responsibility. One thing I would really like people to understand is how racism hurts the nation as a whole. I think Americans are just now coming to realize that most of the world is not white. Most of the world does not share our assumptions about race. Because most of the world doesn't, we are in many ways isolated when we try to deal with cultures that are so different from ours. And we lose some of our greatest assets when we don't make use of or allow people of color to contribute the knowledge they have to our efforts to understand and interact with people who are not white.</p>\n\n<p>America really does look like the world. And because we represent the world in many ways, we need to be able to draw upon that to understand the world. We lose by not giving opportunities to people who can help us make sense of the world. And the nation itself suffers because of that.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-how-do-we-dispel-racist-ideology-c7c","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaHowDoWeDispelRacistIdeology","path":"/qa/how-do-we-dispel-racist-ideology","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"bad69eb3-9397-4efc-b157-0ca6d0626b30"},"updatedAt":1531286317661,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"bad69eb3-9397-4efc-b157-0ca6d0626b30"}}
