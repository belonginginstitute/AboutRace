How does this differ from the use and/or concepts of race throughout world history? Especially re the existence of slavery for thousands of years?</p>"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>I think of course, it depends on how you define race. If you're talking about us and them, the attitude of hostility to people we find different, we can find manifestations of that on different grounds throughout history. The word xenophobia, for example, fear of the stranger, is a Greek word which certainly is almost a universal human phenomenon. I think race comes when there's a sense of innate or unbridgeable difference, and that, in my opinion, develops not really in the United States first, but in Europe, first in the late Middle Ages and early modern period, and then becomes further developed in the United States. It's the idea of a sense of difference that can't be overcome by religious conversion or some other process of assimilation.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, slavery has existed for thousands of years, and slavery was reserved mostly for people who were ethnic strangers, who were outside of the tribe, or outside of the family groups that were enslaving them. But what you normally find is that there is a process by which these people, or at least their descendants, can become incorporated through being freed, intermarrying with the group they were brought into, and being assimilated into the tribe, so there's a certain element of ethnicity inherent in most forms of slavery that have existed, but it's ethnicity that does not have the rigidity, does not have the permanence and association with clear-cut physical traits that we find in racism.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>Race has also been used in a variety of ways that today we would have a hard time understanding. For example, the Irish were seen by the English as a separate race. I think many of us know that, especially during the Second World War period and before, Jewish people were often referred to as part of the Jewish race. In this way, the term race, by today's standards, was used very loosely to define the other, which is different from how we think of it today.</p>\n\n<p>As Audrey mentioned, in societies before, people could be enslaved for all sorts of reasons. Originally, a slave was a person taken in combat. Rather than being killed, they were taken as a prisoner of war, and used as a forced laborer. Now, there's a very important distinction between the idea of a person as a forced laborer and the idea of a slave in the American context. If you are taken in a war and you become a forced laborer or slave, that means you are a slave because of circumstances. And the person for whom you work is in his situation because of circumstances. And we all know that had circumstances been different, the roles might have been reversed.</p>\n\n<p>In American society, the notion emerged that a person was a slave because of God's will. Because of something peculiar to that person that made it acceptable for that person to be held in this position of forced labor, and for this condition to be passed along generation after generation after generation. Because it wasn't just circumstances. And it wasn't even something peculiar to this person. It was something peculiar to the larger group from which this person comes - a special category of human bondage. Now that, then, is what's distinctive, and it's what is so difficult for us to deal with today. This notion that people were slaves because of something peculiar to the larger group from which this person comes. Slavery is gone, but the characteristics attributed to this larger group still remain. That's what racism is all about.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null,"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"8bd2ab46-3dab-4d28-8d25-67ebff32d455","name":"Racial Classifiation: Changing Categories","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab0ca872-c88f-4e8c-9623-d787a99e6bbf"}}
