It created a situation where, if you say that all men are created equal, but then you say that some men, or human beings, are to be enslaved, that creates a real contradiction. One way out of that contradiction - which is the basis for the more articulate, overt racism that comes about in the 19th century - is to say, \"Well, these people aren't quite human. These people are not capable of exercising their freedom and equality.\" So I think that an interesting situation developed. The analogy sometimes made was to women and children. Women and children, after all, are human, but in the early 19th century, nobody thought they should have full rights. To take a whole race of people and say they're like women or children because they're biologically incapable of exercising the rights of citizenship is an argument that was made, along with \"We're the master race and we reserve equality and freedom for the master race.\"</p>"},"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"Myth of the Founding Fathers","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Didn't the Founding Fathers oppose slavery?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>First of all, a comment about the question.
