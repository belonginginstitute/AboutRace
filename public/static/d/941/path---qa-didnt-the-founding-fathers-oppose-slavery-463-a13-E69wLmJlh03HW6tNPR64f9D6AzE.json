The question seems to indicate that revisionist interpretations of history are one, somehow new, and two, somehow negative. The fact is that every generation provides a revisionist interpretation of history. And largely that generation revises history from its own standpoint, its own vantage point. The job of the historian is to interpret and revise history based upon new evidence and new interpretations of that evidence. That's what historians are supposed to do. We, for example, would not be upset about the presentation of revisionist medicine. Who among us would say I like medicine the way it was a hundred or two hundred years ago, I don't want you to revise medicine. Well, just as medicine is revised, as doctors and medical technicians learn more about medicine, history is revised as historians learn more about history.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the references to slavery by the founding fathers or during the era of the founding fathers, it is certainly true that not all the founding fathers accepted slavery as inevitable or that which should be tolerated in a freedom-loving society. There were many people at the time, some in the United States, some in England, who recognized that there was a great inconsistency between this nation coming into existence, announcing to the world that it is basing its fundamental character, its fundamental principle, on human freedom, and the fact that that same nation tolerated the institution of slavery. Unfortunately, some of the most powerful people in this newly emerging country were themselves slaveholders. That is, people whose fortunes were tied up in the institution of slavery. And in order to bring the nation into being, there was a compromise made, between those people who would have, left to their own devices, not tolerated the institution of slavery, and those people whose societies were built on the institution of slavery. That compromise was so delicate that if you look at the constitution, the word slave or slavery does not appear until the 13th Amendment in 1865. It was the issue too hot to handle at the constitutional convention. Therefore, many of the founding fathers understood that the only way they could really deal with this question of slavery is to not deal with this question of slavery - to compromise by saying as little as possible.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>We know a lot about how slavery began in North America, and we know that there were a lot of people who were theoretically opposed to slavery, even Jefferson himself was, as George said, opposed to slavery. But this didn't stop them from owning and exploiting slaves. I mean the reality, the economic reality was that they needed the slaves, and this points to the fundamental hypocrisy of the Founding Fathers, because so many of them did own slaves, and people ought to know that.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think the economic necessity of slavery in a free society created a profound dilemma. It created a situation where, if you say that all men are created equal, but then you say that some men, or human beings, are to be enslaved, that creates a real contradiction. One way out of that contradiction - which is the basis for the more articulate, overt racism that comes about in the 19th century - is to say, \"Well, these people aren't quite human. These people are not capable of exercising their freedom and equality.\" So I think that an interesting situation developed. The analogy sometimes made was to women and children. Women and children, after all, are human, but in the early 19th century, nobody thought they should have full rights. To take a whole race of people and say they're like women or children because they're biologically incapable of exercising the rights of citizenship is an argument that was made, along with \"We're the master race and we reserve equality and freedom for the master race.\"</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"90a28dc8-acb9-42e7-94fe-d2c2c545790b"}}
