I don't like the expression because it sets the wrong terms for discussion when it comes to issues of race, equality, and social justice. To me, \"blind\" means not being able to see things, and wanting to be \"blind\" to color or race seems to mean wanting to ignore race or pretend its social and historical effects don't exist. When the larger question is how do we have an equitable society today, we have to be mindful of the historical and social complexities of race, not willfully ignore them. [Unless, of course, one believes that race doesn't have or hasn't had any impact, in which case there's no need for discussion.] We should strive to be color \"full\" rather than colorblind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis doesn't mean, however, that we should divide people by race today.

I don't like the expression because it sets the wrong terms for discussion when it comes to issues of race, equality, and social justice. To me, \"blind\" means not being able to see things, and wanting to be \"blind\" to color or race seems to mean wanting to ignore race or pretend its social and historical effects don't exist. When the larger question is how do we have an equitable society today, we have to be mindful of the historical and social complexities of race, not willfully ignore them.
