If slaveholders could have actually stood up and said, \"We are holding these people in bondage because we need their labor and we have the power to do it.\" The advantage of that would have been that once the power was removed, then bondage was over and the justification for bondage was over. But because we were living in a society that professed to the world that we believed in the God-given right of human freedom and liberty, in order for us to hold people in bondage, we were forced to come up with a rationalization for that position. Which we based on race. The difficulty, then, is that after the bondage is outlawed and slavery is ended, the rationalization for slavery - the means by which we tried to reconcile this great inconsistency - remains. Today's society is plagued by that rationalization. We are still suffering from, trying to come to grips with this rationalization. And that rationalization is what today we call racism.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>Race or racism is a legacy of slavery to some degree. De Tocqueville sort of predicted what was going to happen when he said that in the ancient world, in Rome, when they emancipated slaves, two or three generations would pass and you wouldn't know who was of slave ancestry. But, he said, where the slaves are a different color, then slave ancestry will be detectable, will be recognizable. The marks, in other words, of servitude or probable slave ancestry would remain. So I think slavery created a sense of difference that survived its demise. In fact, most people would agree that racism became more intense after slavery was abolished, because now there was a possible situation of competition and the status that whites had when they were free and most blacks were slaves was no longer the differentiator, and therefore you have the sense that to remain in a privileged position, to retain our status, we have to emphasize our race.</p>\n\n<p>As many historians have shown, immigrants coming from Europe managed to gain status by laying claim to white membership, by stressing that they were white, and therefore, differentiating themselves from blacks. There became a situation where, as Audrey put it, self-esteem, status, and privilege depended on skin color, and many whites were very reluctant to give that up and still are.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null,"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"e1364a55-f51c-423a-8ca8-aa358bfcf496","name":"Structured Advantage: Legislation and Government Policy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Slavery","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Origin of the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/e3f5057598e4282d7625bcd78f0e26ba-46c6517c120b733ef8c2f9a0ce6c4eb3.png"}}}},{"title":"Africans, Slavery, and Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>With the hardening of slavery came the emergence of race.
