If you looked at any gene, at random, you'd probably get a pattern similar to what you found for the mitochondrial DNA. Because we know what the pattern is. Eighty-five percent of the detectable genetic variation, no matter what you look at, is within groups rather than between groups. Therefore, you're far more likely to find matches among people from different populations than you are to find all Africans clustered together and all Europeans clustered together. That said, however, you can if you look hard enough, find a gene that will cluster that way. Because we do know that there is some geographical variation. As we were talking about earlier, there is somewhere genetic control of hair form. And if you could find that gene, you would find people with straight hair forming a cluster and people with kinky hair forming a cluster. But that doesn't mean you can make a larger claim about other shared traits or characteristics.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":null,"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-when-looking-for-genetic-variation-does-it-make-a-difference-519","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhenLookingForGeneticVariationDoesItMakeADifference","path":"/qa/when-looking-for-genetic-variation-does-it-make-a-difference","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"e61ebb63-811c-4451-aaee-b050457b5281"},"updatedAt":1531342933082,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"e61ebb63-811c-4451-aaee-b050457b5281"}}
