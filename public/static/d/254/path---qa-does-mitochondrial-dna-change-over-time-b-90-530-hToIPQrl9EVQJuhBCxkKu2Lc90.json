Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow. Unfortunately, it's very hard to distinguish one pattern from the other. Are two populations similar by virtue of sharing common ancestry or genetic unions?
