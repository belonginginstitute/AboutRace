Another story that's been used by people who don't accept the idea of the curse on Ham, but want to say that there are innate differences that should require people to be segregated is the story of the Tower of Babel. The story of the Tower of Babel has been interpreted as meaning that cultures should not mix, languages should not mix. The Afrikaaners used this in South Africa, the Dutch Reform Church, to justify apartheid. Recently, Bob Jones University used this doctrine to justify a ban on interracial dating. So the Tower of Babel story has been used more often than people realize.</p>\n\n<p>But if you talk about the Bible, you're talking about a source of belief and wisdom that can be applied in many different ways, and in the hands of Martin Luther King or Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Bible clearly supports the idea of racial equality. After all, the Bible does say, \"God made of one blood all the races of the world.\" That passage has been used over and over again in the history of Christianity to resist extreme racism, to resist racism which would say that blacks or Jews lack souls to be saved. The universalist aspect of the Bible was used by abolitionists and it was used by advocates of civil rights. So the Bible can also be, and has been, a weapon for liberation and equality, and I think it can continue to be that.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I would say that the Bible played no role initially in the construction of racial inequalities, but I think it's people who have misused the Bible to justify one way or another their racism, for example.
