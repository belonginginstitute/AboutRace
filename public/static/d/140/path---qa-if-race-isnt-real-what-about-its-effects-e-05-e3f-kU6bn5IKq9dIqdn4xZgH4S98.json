How can people embrace this view without denying the history and experience that has been the product of this illusion?</p>"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>While it's important to emphasize that race is a kind of illusion, it doesn't mean that the effects of race, regardless of the origins of the notion, haven't actually been very real. It's important to distinguish between race and racism. Racism is not an illusion. Its social consequences are and have been very real. You want to avoid the conclusion that well, if race is not real, then racism is not real and we shouldn't fight it. Simply knowing that race is an illusion isn't actually enough. You actually have to know how the illusion has worked.</p>\n\n<p>Developing social policies to redress racism can get you into this Catch-22 of trying to define something that \"isn't real\" - if you confuse race with racism. Perhaps the proper way to address it is to formulate policies based on racism. In other words, formulate policies to address the consequences and not the origins. If you address the economic and psychological consequences of racism, you can in some ways address the problems without addressing race. At the same time, it's often necessary to keep track of racial categories in order to measure the effects of policy. I don't think you can completely throw race out, but you have to use it very cautiously.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be very hard to convince people that as human beings, they will never be conscious of some sort of physical differences between people and create categories in their minds based on perceived physical differences. It's hard to imagine erasing consciousness of what you might want to loosely call \"race.\" But there's a difference between being conscious of race and using that idea in order to create institutional mechanisms that then create unequal social consequences for different groups.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think the only thing that's illusory about race is the idea that it's fixed biologically. There's no denying that the idea of race has existed as a historical fact and that its particular historical existence has had dramatic impacts on people. The only thing we can agree on about race is what it isn't. And I think that one of our challenges lies in thinking about its role in the future and to engage the public in a debate about what it has been in the past, how people have seen it, what impact it's had, and what kind of impact it is having today. And then you're faced with the problem of how to get people who control a lot of institutions, who are benefiting from privileges based on race - how do you get them to go back and account for the impact that racial categories have had historically?<br />\nÂ </p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"David Freund"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"98f2a0c2-de3b-4ec0-ae35-10d9919cd0c4"}}
