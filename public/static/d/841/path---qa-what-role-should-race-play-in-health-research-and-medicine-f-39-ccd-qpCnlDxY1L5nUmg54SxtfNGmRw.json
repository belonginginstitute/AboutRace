Not only are laypersons confused, but scientists and doctors are also confused, and they make critical decisions based on what they think race is. The bottom line is that race was once thought to explain most human variation in genetics and biology. However, like the idea that the earth is flat, this notion of race has not stood the test of time. Human biological variation is remarkably complex and fascinating. It is best described in ways that capture this complexity. The idea of race, that humans are lumped into a finite number of groups, does not do the job. On the other hand, racializing and racisms have potentially dire health and medical consequences.<br /><br />\nThankfully, the old notion of race as inherent biology has been disproved, making it more apparent that racial differences in health must be due to myriad differences in life experience. We need to do an even better job of understanding how what we gloss as race relates to medical care and health. We can no longer take the shortcut of assuming that skin color provides deeper genetic meanings. I predict that the greatest understanding of health will come from going beyond assigning race in a haphazard manner to probing life experiences that may relate to the lived experience of being perceived and self perceived as a member of one or more races. Even though race is not based in biology, racism has biological consequences.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>The use of racial categories in medicine and biomedical research has led to a great deal of confusion and many disputes among scientists, health professionals and the public. Recognizing important distinctions among the categories \"natural,\" \"biological\" and \"genetic\" is a key to making sense of this controversy.</p>\n\n<p>Human races are not genetically definable categories. There are no subdivisions found \"in nature\" that separate one race or group of humans from another. Race might be better defined as a social hierarchy - a set of social relationships through which some groups of people are subordinated while others are elevated in power and status.</p>\n\n<p>Although races are created socially they are, nonetheless, real, in the same sense that marriage or the school year are real. Furthermore, as we relate to each other in terms of race, we create material conditions in the world. Race is a powerful predictor of where a person lives, where and to what degree she is educated, how much money she makes, whether she has health insurance, how she is treated by physicians, and the degree to which she is exposed to toxic substances in her work or home environment. These material manifestations of race can have direct and indirect health consequences, thereby establishing a relationship between the social realities of race and our human biology.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, human organisms respond biologically to social experience. We do find racial disparities in rates of diabetes or responses to medications, and these are important to study. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is that when we observe racial differences in health status we should not infer that these are caused by genetic differences between/among races. Our current knowledge suggests that genetics is the least likely cause of most racial disparities in health.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks    "},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"9c3ebf1d-e77c-463d-a59c-09fa4a6dc2d7"}}
