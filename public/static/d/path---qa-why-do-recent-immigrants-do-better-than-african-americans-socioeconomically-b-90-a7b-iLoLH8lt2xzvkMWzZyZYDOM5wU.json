Now they earn above-average incomes and own houses in \"white suburbs.\" What accounts"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>This is a really big, complicated question. And significantly, the answer to that varies by ethnic group, by a group's particular history in the United States, and even by the period in U.S. history we're talking about. But to bring it up to the present, we cannot generalize about blacks or Asians or Middle Eastern or white immigrants, because their statuses have changed. Nonetheless, there are some things that I would argue are constant. First, the vast majority of immigrants who come to this country do so not just because they want to, but also because they have family, extended family, or other links to immigrant communities here, and those extended immigrant communities provide networks. These networks have access to capital and job markets that help these new immigrants get established and eventually accumulate wealth. Often these localized immigrant middle-class communities can provide connections and opportunities for these newer, equity-poor immigrants.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast - and for a number of historical reasons - the black middle class is often not nearly as affluent, nor is their wealth as localized or centralized and therefore cannot provide that same level of support. Furthermore there are simply far more blacks in the United States than there are poor recent immigrants, hence the wealth of their middle-class counterparts is spread even more thinly. This gets back to this issue that is so central to the film series: the long history of the political and economic discrimination against certain racial groups. The black middle class and other minority middle classes are equity poor in large part because of this long history. To this day, it's still comparably much more difficult for certain groups to accumulate wealth. Many immigrants advantaged with easier access to capital through these personal networks are also less likely to be the victims of discrimination by government and private institutions, both in the past and today.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it's really important to note that throughout U.S. history, many immigrants have not fared so well. And it's significant to note which groups these are. Hispanic immigrants historically have had a much harder time accumulating wealth than other immigrants, be they European, Asian, or Middle Eastern. Poor black immigrants from the Caribbean, South America, and Africa, have also not fared as well. Likewise, many recent Asian immigrants have come to this country quite destitute, often fleeing political turmoil in the '70s and '80s, and they have likewise struggled in comparison to Asians from other regions, or those who came in other time periods. So I think that if you look at the wide variation in immigrant experience, it provides further evidence that this larger history of discrimination still is a really powerful force. Not all immigrants have been able to establish themselves economically and politically, and more often than not, the immigrants who have generally done best, are those considered white, those who have \"become\" white over time, or those who are considered to be the least threatening to whites in the United States.<br />\nÂ </p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>This \"immigrants vs. African Americans\" narrative represents the kind of classic model-minority argument that conservatives have deployed since day one to argue why affirmative action is not needed for African Americans and other non-Asian American minorities. And they often use Asian Americans in order to make this point - to say that Asians came with nothing and now they're graduating valedictorians of their class. I call this tactic racial mascotting, and it's quite insidious.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, a minority group is being deployed with the particular purpose of using them against another minority group by the white majority. This \"racial pitting\" translates into everyday life in ways that are not even meant to be conspiratorial. For example, among educators, it is well understood that the ways in which we approach students can make a big difference in terms of how they perform. If a teacher has preconceived perceptions of Asians as model-minority whiz kids, it will certainly affect her expectations of them and how she treats them. What about a teacher's assumptions regarding black children? Will she be quicker to place them in special ed classrooms based on stereotypical assumptions? Statistics suggest so.</p>\n\n<p>I think we have to understand that the problem is a very complex one in which culture, stereotypes, and assumptions affect the interactions of these various groups.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Dalton Conley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Sumi Cho"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"John Cheng"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>Not all immigrants are self-selected. I think there are two different populations of people who enter the United States: the super-heroic achievers and the people who come here for a variety of other reasons. If you look at the Asian American immigrant population, for example, you see there are two distinct populations that happen to be from the same region, but have different backgrounds. The ones who do well are ambitious and have means and access to capital. The achievers consist of relatively educated professionals with certain language skills, backgrounds or aspirations and access to communities where they have collaborative access to capital. The second group is often made up of individuals who work or are looking to work in low-wage occupations, sometimes as refugees, sometimes brought by recruiters or contractors. Often they are individual women or men. So I mean, there's this myth of the immigrant in the United States, but the reality of most immigrants who came is that they were of the second labor group, not the capital group.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point to keep in mind is that this question presumes immigrants and African Americans are mutually exclusive. In fact, there are quite a number of African immigrants coming to the U.S. And even today, race affects new immigrants coming here in different ways.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-why-do-recent-immigrants-do-better-than-african-americans-socioeconomically-b90","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhyDoRecentImmigrantsDoBetterThanAfricanAmericansSocioeconomically","path":"/qa/why-do-recent-immigrants-do-better-than-african-americans-socioeconomically","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"ef5cb15d-8fb0-4718-98cd-b838edde1b2b"},"updatedAt":1531342933088,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"ef5cb15d-8fb0-4718-98cd-b838edde1b2b"}}
