Many Black Americans have white and Native American ancestry, yet that fact is often ignored. Doesn't that make the study invalid?"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>This question assumes that there are \"pure\" black people someplace outside of the US. Also, it assumes that race is all about ancestry. Neither of these assumptions is correct. Black people in the world have a variety of different genotypes and ancestries, as do members of every other racial group. Many white Americans have black and Native American ancestors and many Native Americans have white or black ancestors. Any attempt to designate an ideal or canonical genotype for a race of people, or a definitive ancestral lineage, would be entirely arbitrary. Also, any attempt to do this would have surprising results. If we were trying to find an Asian ideal, we would exclude many people generally identified as Asian, and probably include some who are not so identified in everyday life. Historically, some societies have tried to define \"ideal\" or \"pure\" racial types - the Nazis attempted to do this in the mid-twentieth century, and the Spain of Torquemada did it in the fifteenth century. When a society expends many resources attempting to find an ideal racial type, it is usually so that it can discriminate against those who do not meet the ideal.</p>\n\n<p>The notion that there exist people who are purely of one race or another probably stems from the idea that at some time in history, groups of people were isolated on each continent, that these groups had children only with each other for many generations, and that these continentally isolated populations are reflected in our current human races. Subpopulations in other species are formed when a small group of individuals becomes an isolated breeding population for many generations, then the isolated group develops significant genetic dissimilarity to other populations of the same species. However, there is no evidence that human races were ever isolated breeding populations; people have always mingled with their neighbors, have always migrated and traded, and by having children together we traded genes as well as trinkets.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>In response to the other part of the question, about how subjects are chosen, it depends on the particular research project. Some studies ask where your grandparents were born, for instance. Such studies are really categorizing people according to ancestry, not race. Most studies now, if they're trying to group people by race, rely on recommendations from government agencies. The guidelines suggest that you first ask people a question about ethnicity - are you Hispanic or not Hispanic? - and then ask a question about race. So it's based on self-identification. Participants do have the opportunity to identify themselves as having more than one race, but researchers are supposed to be able to take whatever the research subjects say and collapse that back down into the administrative categories that the government uses, which are White, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black.</p>\n\n<p>This question raises the important point that scientists need to be very clear about who they are studying and why they are studying those particular people. Just because black and white Americans may have \"mixed\" ancestry, does not make all research that uses racial categories invalid. It depends on what the scientist is trying to study. Race is a very, very powerful social category in the U.S., it influences where we live, what schools we attend, what jobs we have, what kinds of stresses we experience, whether we have access to health care, and many other aspects of our lives. Because race is such a powerful social category, it can influence our biology and our health. What is invalid is to assume that any difference between races must have a genetic cause.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-how-are-subjects-selected-for-drug-studies-by-race-11a","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaHowAreSubjectsSelectedForDrugStudiesByRace","path":"/qa/how-are-subjects-selected-for-drug-studies-by-race","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"7651a84d-28c4-4f64-bdd8-d90add7c7ae3"},"updatedAt":1531286317661,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"7651a84d-28c4-4f64-bdd8-d90add7c7ae3"}}
