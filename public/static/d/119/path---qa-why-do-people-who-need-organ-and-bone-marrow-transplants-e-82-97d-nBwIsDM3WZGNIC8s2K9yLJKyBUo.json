Does the higher success rate of intra-racial versus inter-racial transplantation suggest that race has some biological reality?</p>"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>In the organ transplant world, I know there's a big focus on trying to recruit more African Americans to donate organs, under the assumption that race-matched organs are going to have a better chance of success. It's true that people who are closely genetically related are more likely to have a good genetic match on organs. For example, siblings can often donate organs to each other or will be well matched for each other. It doesn't always happen, but it's more likely to happen. So if you're studying a group of people who are actually related because they all live in the same city and their ancestors all came to the U.S. from the same village or community, then it would make some sense that within that group they would be more likely to have matched organs.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it's false to assume that people of the same race are going to be more closely genetically related. To the extent that races are these very huge four or five groupings of human beings, they encompass people who are very distantly related to each other. As distantly related as people of two different races. Intuitively people think that those of the same race are more closely related, but the genetic data show that this assumption is false.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think Jon and Pilar have really hit the major crux of it. I just want to add that even when you accept the assumption built into this question, it may not be true for the reasons you think it is. If the assumption were true, is it because of race? The answer is no, it's not because of race, it's because of geographic closeness and genetic similarity. We tend to be more genetically similar to people whose ancestry we share, but that isn't the same thing as race. You have to look at where the assumption breaks down - individuals from South Africa and North Africa, for example, are very genetically different, and not coincidentally, those two places are also very geographically far away.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Alan Goodman"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"be2244a4-ebbe-4984-ab73-30a20f05e6a9"}}
