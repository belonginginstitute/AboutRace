The more similar two species are, the more closely related they are by common descent. It's a bit more complicated with human populations because there's two ways that human populations can be similar to one another. Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow. Unfortunately, it's very hard to distinguish one pattern from the other. Are two populations similar by virtue of sharing common ancestry or genetic unions? The extraction of historical details from genetic patterns is actually a lot more difficult than it's generally represented in the media. Very commonly, different data sets will give you different narrative stories of origin. Different analysis of the same data, sometimes, will give you different stories as well. I know of genetic data that shows the New World was populated in one wave, in two waves, in three waves, and in more than three waves. So, I tend to be somewhat circumspect about taking historical narratives derived from genetic data at face value. This doesn't mean that you can't do it. It just means that like any other scientific endeavor, you have to be very careful and look very carefully at the set of data and analytic techniques being used.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":null,"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"6eb6bd0b-4696-4b56-ae32-33258446a9c3"}}
