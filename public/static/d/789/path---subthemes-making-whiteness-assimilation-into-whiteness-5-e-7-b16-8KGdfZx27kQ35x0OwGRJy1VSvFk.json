Forty-two percent of the net worth of all households consists of equity in their homes - that means for most Americans, their homes are their single largest asset. Homeownership provides families with the means to invest in education, business opportunities, retirement and resources for the next generation.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>When the federal government stepped in to make it possible for most Americans to finance the purchase of their own home, they essentially paved the way for millions of average white Americans to begin their own wealth-building. But the policies they endorsed made it very difficult for minorities to attain the same resources and opportunities, resulting in deeply segregated communities and an enormous wealth gap between whites and nonwhites that persists to this day. In 1995, the median white family had over 8 times the net worth of the median Black family. The gap is even greater for Latinos - the median white household has over 12 times the wealth of the median Latino family.</p>\n\n<p>Race, wealth and life opportunities are intertwined in the United States. Today, white and nonwhite communities are still \"separate and unequal\" and the gap continues to grow, long after the Civil Rights era. Wealth, and the opportunities it affords, is passed down through successive generations. Along with it, Americans have also inherited a legacy of inequality that continues to shape the future. Segregation and the wealth gap between whites and nonwhites did not arise on their own. And because they are so deeply entrenched in the institutions that structure our society, they will not fade away by simply outlawing discriminatory policies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the state of segregation in the nation's metropolitan areas today? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S. population is more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Yet for the most part, America's neighborhoods remain highly segregated. The only areas that have become more integrated since 1970 are cities with small minority populations.</p>\n\n<p>On the whole, segregation is highest in the major metropolitan areas of the Midwest and Northeast and lower in the West and South.</p>\n\n<p>The 2000 census shows that overall the nation's largest cities have lost large numbers of white residents to suburban and outlying areas. The urban populace is becoming increasingly Latino and Asian, with a slight increase in Black residents.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Lewis Mumford Center at the University of Albany, segregation has increased in almost every large suburban area from 1990 to 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Across the nation, four out of five whites live outside of the cities and 86 percent of whites live in neighborhoods where minorities make up less than 1 percent of the population. In contrast, 70 percent of Blacks and Latinos live in the cities or inner-ring suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Census Bureau's 1999 American Housing Survey, 74 percent of suburban residents owned their own homes, while only about half of urban residents are homeowners. The proportion is similar when you compare homeowners by race - in 1999, 74 percent of whites were homeowners, while only 45 percent of Latinos, 46 percent of Blacks and 51 percent of Asians owned their homes.</p>\n\n<p>Whites are still the most segregated of all racial groups, have the largest suburban presence and are most likely to own their homes. African Americans continue to be highly segregated and as Latinos and Asians gain a larger share of the population, they are becoming increasingly segregated from whites as well. </p>\n\n<p>When whites relocated to the suburbs, their strong tax base and businesses followed. The result: a huge discrepancy in the quality and quantity of resources, jobs and public services in central cities and inner-ring suburbs inhabited by mostly minority populations. As white communities continue the trend of isolating themselves and their resources, the pattern of flight and divestment repeats, and the wealth gap grows larger. </p>\n\n<p>Communities cannot be expected to accomplish integrated, stable neighborhoods on their own. In a 2002 study by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, analysts found evidence of an overwhelming trend toward school district resegregation. Court-ordered busing once made Southern schools the most integrated in the country. However, when many of these programs expired in the 1990s, the proportion of Black students in majority-white schools decreased by 13 percent. Until the problem of residential seclusion is addressed, schools will continue to resegregate by default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But aren't some communities segregated by choice? What about the Chinatowns, Little Ethiopias and other ethnic enclaves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People sometimes assume that certain ethnic or racial groups segregate themselves \"voluntarily,\" but there are many factors involved. These groups often face discrimination when they try to enter established, primarily white communities. Limited job and economic opportunities, language barriers, and shared culture can also influence many groups to cluster. Ethnic enclaves, however, are very different from impoverished urban ghettos. Apart from \"first-settlement\" immigrant neighborhoods, rarely do ethnic groups ever become as highly concentrated as many Black communities. Ethnic groups can tap into various types of resources unavailable to areas of concentrated poverty: networks of friends and relatives, \"niche\" occupations and businesses, etc. Furthermore, ethnic enclaves are more transitory in nature - as stepping stones to entering more privileged, resource-rich communities. Still, many groups (such as Latinos and Asians) will face more barriers based on racial discrimination as they look to move out. </p>\n\n<p>Confronted with racially discriminatory policies, minorities could not take advantage of the programs that made it possible for millions of people to buy homes in the suburbs. People of color remained in the cities while they witnessed their white counterparts leave in droves. Today, mostly minority inner cities are characterized by the unique phenomenon of concentrated poverty. Inner-city residents face intense spatial isolation and inadequate public resources, education and economic opportunities. As more and more people leave, costs for basic services rise and the poor become even poorer. The average inner city consists of abandoned buildings, total business disinvestment, and resource-depleted schools leaving it vulnerable to violent crime, prostitution, and drugs. By the time anti-discriminatory laws were passed, suburban whites were enjoying soaring property values and minorities now faced the economic barriers that replaced those initially created by race. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, after decades of segregation, a culture of poverty has become associated with people of color - particularly African Americans. Inner-city residents are not only surrounded by crime, drugs, homelessness and poverty, they are blamed for it. As john powell says, \"Not only have we racialized our space, but it is through space that we do our 'racing' in the 20th century.\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>How does discrimination, both past and present, continue to affect the life opportunities of nonwhites?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1992, The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released a study showing that Black and Latino mortgage applicants are 60 percent more likely to be turned down for loans than whites, even when they share similar employment and financial backgrounds. </p>\n\n<p>According to a 1998 report by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), African-American mortgage applicants were rejected 217 percent as often as whites - up from 206 percent in 1995. Latino applicants were denied 183 percent as often as whites - up from 169 percent in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>According to a Department of Housing and Urban Development study, high-cost loans are offered five times more often in Black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods. Furthermore, homeowners in upper-income Black neighborhoods were twice as likely to receive these sort of loans than homeowners in low-income white neighborhoods. In 1998, 9 percent of home loans in white neighborhoods were high cost compared to 51 percent of loans in Black neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Nonetheless, housing discrimination persists in subtler forms. Minorities still experience discrimination on an individual level as well as through a variety of systematic practices. Realtors who practice racial steering will direct nonwhites to segregated areas or direct whites away from integrated areas. Minority mortgage applicants who are regularly denied loans more often than their white socioeconomic equals will by necessity turn to predatory lenders who charge them higher-cost loans than their credit histories warrant.</p>\n\n<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced. Even if individual incidences of discrimination are no longer, the current housing market makes it almost impossible for a family with little or no assets to enter it. As home prices in resource-rich communities continue to rise, low to middle-income families must choose between renting or buying in at-risk, often segregated suburban communities. </p>\n\n<p>Ironically, defenders of the racial bias in the home lending system will point to the low net worth of minority applicants, even those with high incomes. As George Lipsitz points out, \"net worth is almost totally determined by past opportunities for asset accumulation, and therefore is the one figure most likely to reflect the history of discrimination.\"</p>"}}],"clips":[{"__typename":"node__clip","id":"130bcf49-8024-413d-b228-bd4667b0b989","field_episode":3,"title":"The melting pot never included people of color.

What do they need to do so profitably?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Jamestown settlers came here to get rich. And it takes them a while. They go through a rough time called The Starving Time in Virginia - which indeed is a rather desperate period. But eventually they discover a commodity, tobacco, which does what they hope it will do. It is not nearly as profitable as sugar. But it is profitable. And that of course transforms Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>We call that the Tobacco Revolution and it transforms Virginia from a very marginal kind of society to a society in which some people can get very, very rich. And of course what they need to get very, very rich is labor. But labor is in very short supply in the New World. It is in particularly short supply in Virginia because a good part of the Native American population has already died off because of warfare with these invaders and in larger measure because of disease. The microbes turn out to be extraordinarily efficient and the people of the New World don't have resistance to a variety of European diseases.</p>\n\n<p>So these potential tobacco barons need labor. And they will pretty much take it wherever they can, wherever they can get it. One source of course is the Native American population, and they try to use them as laborers. Another source is the European population and they will use them as laborers, as free labor but also coerced labor, so-called Indentured Servants. Indentured servants are people who are essentially enslaved for a period of years. And they will also call upon Africans as laborers.</p>\n\n<p>What is interesting about what happens in Virginia is that the Virginians, and also other peoples in the Chesapeake region, in Maryland as well, do not establish the system of slavery immediately. The system is rather open. And many of these people who are of African descent who enter Virginia fall into the status of indentured servants.</p>\n\n<p>Some people of African descent escape from these forms of coerced labor, and begin to behave pretty much like everybody else in the Chesapeake - that is, they try to gain access to some land and some labor to work the land, whether it is free or coerced, whether it is indentured or enslaved. And once they do they begin to do pretty well for themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What were the differences that made a difference in early Virginia?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 17th century Chesapeake area is indeed a multi-racial society. Native Americans, people of African descent, and people of European descent are jumbled up in a variety of ways and they do the kinds of things that people do when they get jumbled up together: They work together. They play together. They fight. They sleep together.</p>\n\n<p>And until we get the formation of plantations, until we get this new institution which demands labor and benefits from squeezing people and wringing out of them as much work as you possibly can, the behavior and the interaction of Europeans and Africans and Native Americans is remarkably open.</p>\n\n<p>They distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. They distinguish themselves by religion - differences between Protestants and Catholics of course are of enormous significance. They distinguish themselves by nationality - distinguishing between Dutch and French and English and Iberian peoples. And of course the English people distinguish between themselves and Scotch and Welsh. And all of them distinguish themselves from the Irish, who are viewed as yet another case entirely from the English perspective.</p>\n\n<p>But however they distinguish themselves, they are arranged in a hierarchical order in which a few are on top and many are on bottom. Hierarchy is ubiquitous in this world. The Kingdom is a hierarchy; there is only one king. The church is a hierarchy, whether you view it from the perspective of Rome and the pope, or whether you view it from the perspective of Canterbury and the Archbishop. The army is a hierarchy, with a general in charge. Wealth is distributed in a hierarchical way. And most importantly, the family is a hierarchy in which the father stands at the head.</p>\n\n<p>And the idea of the father writ large as the pope, as the king, as the general, is something which unites all of these hierarchies - and makes the notion that hierarchy is providential. It's the way God ordered the world. So some people are on the top and others on the bottom. Whether they are indentured servants, slaves, or property-less, free laborers, it's not viewed as anything unusual.</p>\n\n<p>These providential hierarchies, of course, is what distinguishes this world from the radically different world of post- July 4th 1776 when suddenly equality becomes the standard currency. And the new presumption is that all men are created equal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Bacon's Rebellion mark a turning point in American ideas of race, giving birth to, as Edmund Morgan says, both black slavery and American freedom?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bacon's Rebellion is an event which begins to redefine notions of race on the North American continent, or at least in the Chesapeake region.</p>\n\n<p>Before Bacon's Rebellion we certainly have distinctions made between blacks and whites, and we certainly have attitudes on the part of whites and presumably on the part of blacks where they differentiate themselves and where they probably think each is superior to the other.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we see them behaving pretty much the same way. Some numbers of people of African descent have moved into the land owning class, are sometimes owning the servants, are connected with churches, are cognizant of the legal system and so on.</p>\n\n<p>And of course substantial numbers of people of European descent are caught in a system of coerced labor called indentured servitude. And indentured servants, whether they are black or white, are pretty much treated the same way as slaves. Very badly.</p>\n\n<p>Bacon's Rebellion changes that, and what seems to be crucial in changing that is the consolidation after Bacon's Rebellion of a planter class. The planters had not been able to control this rowdy labor force of servants and slaves. But soon after Bacon's Rebellion they increasingly distinguish between people of African descent and people of European descent. They enact laws which say that people of African descent are hereditary slaves. And they increasingly give some power to white independent white farmers and land holders.</p>\n\n<p>That increased power is not equality. Dirt farmers are not elected to the House of Burgess in Virginia; the planters monopolize those offices. But they do participate in the political system. In other words we see slavery and freedom being invented at the same moment.</p>\n\n<p>Now what is interesting about this is that we normally say that slavery and freedom are opposite things -that they are diametrically opposed. But what we see here in Virginia in the late 17th century, around Bacon's Rebellion, is that freedom and slavery are created at the same moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do racial ideas change after Bacon's Rebellion?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What interests us here is how that sense of Otherness continually gains new and different meanings over time and place. In Virginia prior to Bacon's Rebellion we had a much more open system. We have black planters and white planters, black indentured servants and slaves, we have white people who are indentured servants and living in un-freedom.</p>\n\n<p>In that kind of world, distinctions between black and white are of course made. But very few people talk about black people as being stupid or dull or ignorant or dirty or lazy. When they speak of Anthony Johnson [a black planter] there may be disdain in their voice, but generally it is that perhaps he is too clever, he is manipulative. He is untrustworthy. He is a little bit too smooth for them. But somebody like Anthony Johnson has been so successful that it would be foolish to denounce him as stupid or lazy or unproductive.</p>\n\n<p>When we move into the post-Bacon's Rebellion world where slavery and the plantation economy are in place, where black people are arriving in large numbers from Africa, the view of black people changes very rapidly. It is not simply slavery that transforms notions of race. It is this plantation slavery, the advent of the plantation and disciplined, exploitative labor that begins to transform notions of race.</p>\n\n<p>And it is that which I am concerned with here. It's not the origins of ideas of race but how race is continually transformed and given different meanings in different circumstances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did Africans become the slaves of choice in North America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question of why Africans become the people of choice to be enslaved in the New World is a question that doesn't have a simple answer. Or it certainly doesn't have an agreed upon answer. There is certainly a great need for labor in the New World, generally because the Native American peoples die at enormous rates when confronted with the diseases of the Old World, be it African or be it European.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways what we see taking place after Christopher Columbus in the post Columbian world, is a re-peopling of the world because of the enormous mortality rates and the holocaust of Native American peoples.</p>\n\n<p>But still, we had a choice of laborers - so why not the European laborers? We know that Europeans have no problem chopping each other up into small pieces in a series of wars. The Protestants don't like Catholics and Catholics don't like Protestants. And from the English perspective, there seems to be one particular population that does in fact seem slavish or appropriate to enslave. And they, of course, are the Irish.</p>\n\n<p>It is precisely at the same time that the English are settling the New World that they are conquering Ireland. They do so with all of the brutality of the destruction of Native American peoples. And they do so with all of the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade.</p>\n\n<p>The Irish are viewed as a lesser people because they have a kind of semi- nomadic existence. They are viewed as lesser people because of their organization into clans. They are viewed as a lesser people because they are not simply heathen they are something worse than heathen from the English perspective: they are Catholic.</p>\n\n<p>So it is a real question in the 17th century why the English enslave Africans. And I don't think there is an easy or an agreed upon answer to that. Some claim that the question turns upon color distinctions, that there are certain things you can't do to people of European descent, of white skin.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I am uncomfortable with those explanations. I think the explanation may lie more in accessibility, the ability to access slave labor. And then a certain precedent is established once the system is going. By the 17th century African slavery has existed for almost two centuries, which in some ways makes it easier to move against Africans than to move against people of European descent, and against the Irish.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When is slavery as an institution first challenged on ethical grounds?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The questioning of slavery as an institution is a new, radical and recent idea. Questioning the validity, the sanctity, the morality of the institution of slavery comes very, very late in the history of the world. Not till the end of the 18th century, not until the Age of Revolution do we see the institution of slavery questioned. Up until that time slavery is not only ubiquitous, slavery is sanctioned by the state, by the church, by the Christian bible, by the Koran, and by the various texts of other religions.</p>\n\n<p>So this questioning of slavery is a radical departure from the past. And it separates our modern world, in which slavery seems a ridiculously hateful, spiteful, backwards and oppressive institution, from the past. And so this becomes a major dividing point in human history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does Thomas Jefferson, the apostle of freedom, become the first prominent American to give voice to suspicions of innate black inferiority? Why do the new ideas of equality give rise to racial thinking?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thomas Jefferson is often thought of as a paradoxical figure. He is the great spokesman for equality, the author of the Declaration of Independence, a man seeped in the egalitarian revolutionary traditions of the late 18th century, and he likes to think of himself that way.</p>\n\n<p>Of course Jefferson was also a slave holder. And perhaps more than a slave holder. It is he perhaps more than anybody else in his Notes on the State of Virginia who first broaches it \"as a possibility,\" he says, that black people are different than white people, that Africans are different than Europeans.</p>\n\n<p>And this difference is not simply a product of circumstance, it is not simply a product of the environment but Jefferson broaches this possibility that it is something much deeper, something innate. We would say in our own language - Jefferson didn't have this language - we would say genetic. Jefferson thus in some ways becomes the father of a school of racial thought which of course stands in many ways in opposition to the great egalitarian tradition and this is viewed as a great paradox.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective it is not so much a paradox. It seems to me what we have is that Jefferson the egalitarian and the slaver holder perhaps more than anybody else is a person who has thought very deeply about this. He wrestles with these concerns. And his wrestling with these concerns takes him in a variety of directions.</p>\n\n<p>The American Revolution is an extraordinarily important event in world history. And combined with the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, the revolutions in Latin America, this Age of Revolution transforms not simply our own nation but transforms the world as well.</p>\n\n<p>After the American Revolution, after the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Declaration of Independence, the presumption is that all men are created equal. Equality is the point. And what then has to be explained for the very first time in world history is inequality. And why inequality exists. In other words, if all men are created equal, why are some men and women still slaves?</p>\n\n<p>And the explanation for the persistence of slavery can be: \"Well, perhaps there is something wrong with that notion of equality.\" In which case the whole notion of the post Revolutionary world, the whole notion of American nationality, is also wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Or the explanation can be: \"Perhaps these people who are enslaved are not quite men.\" And of course that leads us to a whole sea change in terms of racial thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, the American Revolution gives rise to a tradition of freedom AND a tradition of racialization?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The American Revolution becomes a critical marker in our understanding of America's racial history. From the American Revolution come these two great and oppositional traditions in American life.</p>\n\n<p>First are those people who take seriously the ideals of the American Revolution, that all men are created equal. And out of that radical egalitarian tradition comes the tradition of racial equality, comes the tradition of abolition, and many other egalitarian traditions.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways the great spokesperson for this tradition are slaves and former slaves themselves - Richard Allen to Frederick Douglass through Martin Luther King. They become the great spokesmen for the American egalitarian tradition and continually hose us down with the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence, reminding us of our heritage.</p>\n\n<p>But also out of the Declaration of Independence comes a darker tradition. That tradition is saying that while we accept the notion that all men are created equal but then perhaps some of those people who are enslaved are not quite men. We will keep our ideas of American nationality but we will write certain people out of the human family.</p>\n\n<p>And that is a tradition which also developed and comes to fruition in the in the 19th century, in the great defenders of the institution of slavery, the opponents to emancipation, the protagonists of segregation and Jim Crow.</p>\n\n<p>And so again, this one moment when we become a nation, becomes critical for our understanding of both American nationality and race. Race and freedom are of one piece, are born at that same moment. And that is why we are continually struggling with it all the way into the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do anti-black prejudices grow into an ideology of white supremacy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 19th century is a period of radical transformation of slavery. And with the radical transformation of slavery comes a radical transformation of ideas about race. Some of those ideas are a product of the slave holder's response to the growing anti-slavery movement. Public opinion throughout the world is turning against the institution of slavery. Slaveholders have to defend this institution of slavery in new ways.</p>\n\n<p>And this pushes them to new ideas about race. They start talking about the childlike nature of slaves, simple folk incapable of full adulthood, of protecting themselves, in need of a master. Hence slavery, they claim, is a benevolent institution. Very, very few slaveholders spoke about their slaves that way in the 18th century.</p>\n\n<p>Some slaveholders seemed to go in the opposite direction, depicting slaves as inhuman beasts, always ready to revolt, to plant a hatchet in the back of their owner's head. So, if we have the image of the slave child, we also have the image of the slave beast. They too are in need of a master lest they run rough-shod over society raping, pillaging, destroying civilization. So notions about race don't remain constant. They are constantly changing. And in some measure they are constantly changing because the institution of slavery itself is constantly changing.</p>\n\n<p>And it is that connection between the structure of slavery and how the institution works, and how masters and slaves struggle against each other, which of course is part of the way in which ideas about race are redefined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why doesn't the abolition of slavery bring an end to anti-black feelings? Instead, racism becomes even more virulent at the end of the 19th century.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If one of the markers of America's racial history is the advent of the plantation, and another marker is the American Revolution, certainly the third stop is the Civil War and Reconstruction that follows. With the Civil War of course there is a reclaiming of the great egalitarian tradition, the great tradition of the revolution, and of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal.</p>\n\n<p>It is upon that foundation upon which emancipation rests. Indeed, one of the things that we see both during the Civil War in the northern states and after the Civil War throughout the nation is a real recession of the color line, a real redrawing of lines in attitudes, in ideas, in laws, that are passed. Which open up the society to equal participation in a variety of different ways.</p>\n\n<p>Black people of course are freed, they are made citizens, they participate in the great triumph of the Union. Some 200,000 black men fight in the Union army. That gives them a claim to citizenship that they continue to advertise and which in some measure is recognized.</p>\n\n<p>Reconstruction immediately following the Civil War is a great egalitarian experiment and its successes are numerous. It ultimately fails and of course in its wake comes Jim Crow, comes segregation, comes lynching as well. And with that comes another transformation of notions of race, transformations which in some ways draw perhaps even a harder line between white and black, draw even meaner racial distinctions.</p>\n\n<p>Slavery, for whatever else it was, brought white people and black people together; they had to work together. It made no sense to segregate a slave. By defining a person as a slave you already distinguished them from a free person, distinguished white from black.</p>\n\n<p>But once those legal distinctions disappeared and if you wanted to maintain the social distinctions, you had to create a whole other set of institutions which are eventually called segregation. Moreover, since the line between black and white was no longer hedged by the institution of slavery, you had to create other fences, other barriers to make sure you couldn't confuse a white and black. After all, black people were now citizens of this nation. They had all of the rights of citizens; you had to find ways to either eliminate those rights or to make sure that they were not exercised.</p>\n\n<p>And of course this unleashes an enormous amount of violence, violence that is in some ways implicit in the institution of slavery, but must be explicit in maintaining the distinctions between whites and blacks in the post-Emancipation world. And the more competitive that blacks become with white people, of course, the more dangerous they seem.</p>\n\n<p>One of the interesting things is that many of the institutions that develop in the post-Reconstruction United States had their origins not so much in the slave South but in the free North. It is in the North where the first system of segregation first begins. It is there where race riots first appear. These institutions of course in some ways are superfluous to a slave society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weren't 19th century European immigrants 'raced'?</strong></p>\n\n<p>During the late 19th century the nature of immigration to the Americas changes. The 17th and 18th centuries are the great centuries of African migration. The overwhelming majority of people who come to the New World before 1800 are Africans. In the 19th century that changes. The slave trade is closed and European immigration ultimately becomes the dominant form of immigration.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these European peoples are at the bottom of American society. They are the workers and they are the day laborers, and they are factory workers in particular.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the things which are said about these European workers are the same thing which are said at various times about people of African descent. Despite the fact that they are working people, they are lazy. They are untrustworthy. They can't show up to the factory on time. They are undisciplined. They are improvident. And all of these things attach themselves at various times to a whole series of European peoples, beginning with the Irish, then Germans in the 1860s, then a whole series of eastern Europeans and northern Europeans - Italians, Slavs, and Nordic people as well.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways this is a process of racialization, of defining people at the bottom as Others. One of the ways of course that these new immigrants try to protect themselves is to distinguish themselves from that furthest pole of Otherness. They to try to distinguish themselves from black people. And in the process of doing this, they often adopt the very language which is used against them.</p>\n\n<p>So, once again, we have these two great traditions. One tradition of equality coming out of the Declaration of Independence and this is a tradition that many immigrant and working peoples identify themselves with. And then there is that other tradition of defining people as Others - that is, separating them out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does it mean to be an American?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Defining ourselves as a people means defining who is in but it also means defining who is out. These are reciprocal processes.</p>\n\n<p>I think for all of us it begins with the Declaration of Independence. It begins with Jefferson's great promise of American nationality. And extends through the Abolitionist Movement, through the Feminist Movement, through the Labor Movement, and an attempt in some ways to fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence. The struggle for emancipation during the Civil War is part of this struggle. So is the struggle for decent wages, the Civil Rights Movement. We define who we are by identifying our values and saying collectively that this is what we believe.</p>\n\n<p>But at the very same time when we are doing this we are also defining who we are not. And defining who we are not means sometimes defining groups of people as the Other. Sometimes it means demonizing other people as we distinguish ourselves from them.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that what is most painful about this process is that these are two sides to the same coin. The very process of defining who is in also is a process of defining who is out. And hence an Other maybe will always be with us. Even as we try to celebrate what is best and what is most universal in American life.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"87c58c4e-4709-4389-be59-c7380951a2ac","name":"Making Whiteness: Assimilation into Whiteness","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}},{"id":"5f13c4cd-25f4-4114-bf5f-bf3063cb9704","name":"Founding Race: Enslavement and Indian Removal","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}},{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"5f665e42-46f4-4c5e-b27a-70bd23bb77f5","name":"Enslavement (DUPLICATE - COMBINE WITH ENSLAVEMENT AND INDIAN REMOVAL)","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Colonialism","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Slavery, and the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/9ce2075939e2d48f0db2848fde0b0af5-9972893df12cce8eba77938c24d03308.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Why are there different levels of advancement in varying countries by race?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>First of all, what we're dealing with here are assumptions based on western education.

After all, the Bible does say, \"God made of one blood all the races of the world.\" That passage has been used over and over again in the history of Christianity to resist extreme racism, to resist racism which would say that blacks or Jews lack souls to be saved. The universalist aspect of the Bible was used by abolitionists and it was used by advocates of civil rights. So the Bible can also be, and has been, a weapon for liberation and equality, and I think it can continue to be that.</p>"},"changed":1531506386}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Bacon's Rebellion","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Origin of the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/e3f5057598e4282d7625bcd78f0e26ba-46c6517c120b733ef8c2f9a0ce6c4eb3.png"}}}},{"title":"Africans, Slavery, and Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>With the hardening of slavery came the emergence of race.

People hardly ever talk about the other half of the coin, which is, 'How does race benefit whites?' And I think it benefits whites in many ways, and some are very evident.</p>"},"field_full_length_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>What does the wealth gap have to do with race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The one statistic that best captures the state of racial inequality in America today is wealth, or net worth. If you want to know your net worth, just add up everything you own, subtract all your debts and that's your net worth.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the average Black family has only one-eighth the net worth or assets of the average white family. That difference has seemingly grown since the 1960s, since the Civil Rights triumphs, and is not explained by other factors like education, earnings rates or savings rates. It is really the legacy of racial inequality from generations past. No other measure captures the legacy - the cumulative disadvantage of race for minorities or cumulative advantage of race for whites - than net worth or wealth.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth gaps between blacks and whites aren't explained by income. In fact, if you compare people at the bottom of the income distribution - say, a family that makes around $15,000 a year, you'll find that the average black family that earns $15,000 year in income has $0 net worth, or is in debt actually. Compare that with the average white family that earns $15,000 a year, and they have a good $10,000 to $15,000 in equity. That means being poor, being at the bottom of the income distribution, really means two different things depending on whether you are black or white.</p>\n\n<p>That white family has a little bit of a cushion. If unemployment strikes, as it does so often to people at the bottom of the economic distribution, they've got some means to ride out the storm. They might have a car that will increase the radius of their job search. They might have this money that they can spend in case of a medical emergency, even if they don't have health insurance. But compare that to the situation for a poor black family with $0 or negative net worth. There is no cushion. There is nothing in between the paycheck and homelessness, so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>The same kind of disparity emerges at the upper end of the income distribution. If you compare, say, a white family that earns $50,000 with an African American family that earns $50,000, you'll find that the white family has about double the net worth - about $80,000 to $100,000 of net worth compared to about $40,000 to $50,000 of net worth for the African American family at that income level. So when you are talking about the difference between financing their kid's college education, starting a new business, moving if they need to move for a better job opportunity - having $100,000 versus $50,000 in net worth might make the difference between upward mobility and stagnation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do other groups compare in terms of wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Blacks and whites really anchor the ends of the distribution in terms of wealth in America. Latinos fall somewhere in the middle. They fall, on average, closer to the African American average in terms of wealth. But there is enormous disparity within the Latino community. It's hard to talk about Latinos as a unified group because there are enormous differences within that community. And not coincidentally, how Hispanics fare depends on their skin color and it also depends on the particular history of that group.</p>\n\n<p>Cuban Americans, for example, have wealth levels that are much more similar to whites. They don't exactly equal the white levels, but they come close. On the other hand, Puerto Ricans or Dominicans are almost equivalent to the black average. Other groups, like Mexicans and South Americans, fall closer to that group, but again are in the middle somewhere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you define whiteness?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Defining whiteness is really difficult because it is a default category. It's something that we don't define. And part of whiteness is the fact that whites don't have to think about race. In the introductory sociology class I teach, I do an experiment with my students. On the first day of class, I ask them to write down five characteristics to describe themselves. And then I don't make any mention of it. Eight weeks later, when we get to race and ethnicity in the course, I ask them, okay, turn back to your first page, and tell me what you wrote down. I can predict almost to a person that racial minorities in the crowd will have put their race at or near the top of the list, while the whites in the group, except for a couple of troublemakers, don't have it on the list. They might put Polish or Italian or Irish - some sort of national origin up there on the list. But they don't put white or Caucasian or Euro-American.</p>\n\n<p>Ethnicity might matter but race doesn't matter to white people. And that is part of what whiteness is. It's not having to think about being in the norm or dominant group. Beyond that, it is also a sense of privilege, a sense that this society is stacked in your favor and you can do anything, because the American society, the American economy, is sort of like a banquet and you can keep going up for more helpings. That is your system. It belongs to you. So there is a sense of entitlement that comes with whiteness as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's an example of white privilege?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In trying to understand the power and privilege of whiteness, I like to get whites to ask themselves, how did I get my job? That is a good question to start with. Because very few people get their job in some formal way, where they see an ad in the paper, and then go apply, get an interview and then get the job. Mostly, people get their jobs through social networks and connections. Usually it's someone you know - your uncle in the next city or a friend of a friend who knows somebody in your industry. And that is how we get the foot in the door.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, because most jobs in businesses are controlled or owned by whites, given the structure of ownership in America, that leads to the perpetuation of racial inequality in the labor market. Whites tend to hire whites because they get them through their personal networks, which tend to be white. Minorities who aren't as directly connected to the people who are owning and controlling jobs are left out of this. And of course, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in a vicious circle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does wealth affect life outcomes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The single largest item in most people's nest egg is the family home. That has enormous consequences for the next generation. It means, for example, that if you own your home and have significant equity, you're in a high-property tax district, and you're going to a good, well-funded public school.</p>\n\n<p>It means that when it's time to go to college, if you don't have money in the bank, you can always take a second mortgage and draw off the equity in your home to finance your kids' college education. It means that you're in a neighborhood, most likely in the suburbs, where jobs are on the increase, and not in the inner city where jobs are on the decrease.</p>\n\n<p>It means that you're in a neighborhood where your neighbors control information and access to jobs. So you're getting the cultural aspects by virtue of living in a high property value area and you can get your kids better job connections. It means that if you want to finance your kids' job search after school, you'll have equity to support them for a while.</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few of the ways that having wealth, or owning a home, has enormous consequences for the next generation, not to mention one's own old age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does home ownership help you accumulate wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is this tendency for white Americans to see the structure of their aid in the form of tax credits and not as aid, or government assistance, or welfare. But they see other forms of assistance, like reduced rents or welfare benefits, as a direct handout from Big Brother.</p>\n\n<p>Owning your home, first of all, gets you a big mortgage deduction. That means you pay less income tax than you would be paying if you were renting and making similar monthly payments. Second, it probably places you in a community that has higher property values than one where you were just renting. Owner-occupied communities tend to be valued more, and that means that the property tax base is higher. That means that local services, everything from garbage services on up to the public school system, most importantly, are going to be better off in that community. So, without even having to spend your equity in your home, you are getting benefits from it.</p>\n\n<p>Third, there is the ability to borrow off that equity. You can finance starting up a business by taking a second mortgage. You can pay for your kids to go to college through a second mortgage. You can finance your retirement by selling your home. Since homes have increased so much in value over the course of the latter half of the 20th century, people can finance their retirements through the sale of their home and the capital gains they get from it. The home has been a central part of savings for most American families in the latter half of the 20th century. White Americans that is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What role did the government play in shaping housing and wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The American government provided low-interest loans to returning veterans and other white Americans after World War II. This created a boom in home ownership and helped suburbanize America, but blacks were excluded from participating. At this same time, the government was building high-rise public housing for minorities in inner cities. The segregation in America between a largely dark inner city and a largely white suburban community is not something that just magically happened from market forces. It is part and parcel government policy.</p>\n\n<p>When the government instituted rental housing in inner cities, in the form of public housing projects, for poor minorities, and then developed home ownership in low-cost, suburban communities for low-income whites, where you could put almost nothing down, they created this incredible wealth gap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does housing have to do with wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Where one's family lives in America is not just a matter of taste and preference. It has important consequences for the perpetuation of advantage or disadvantage across generations for a lot of reasons. First, you have the issue of housing and wealth. The majority of Americans hold most of their wealth in the form of home equity. So, that is their nest egg. It is their savings bank. They are living in their savings bank.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, the way that we finance education in America public schools is based on local property taxes. This means even if you never cash in the value of your home, just living in a high property value district or a rental and low property value district is going to affect what kind of school your kids go to.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, there are lawsuits in various states against this way of financing, where school funding is based on local property taxes. But still, it's the dominant form. We pay for our schools locally based on property taxes. So, in high value neighborhoods, which are predominantly white, you are getting well-funded schools. And in low-value neighborhoods, which tend to be predominantly minority, you are getting inadequately funded schools.</p>\n\n<p>The constraints that minorities face in the housing market doesn't just affect quality of life issues, you know, and the selection of homes and styles that people can live in. It really has enormous consequences for economic stability and upward mobility and the life chances of the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>Because minorities have faced limited housing options in the past, now they are usually confined to areas that have worse environment conditions, have poor school funding, have increased risk of violent crime, have worse tax bases. Plus their homes have less equity value, so even if they want to move, they are less able to afford to. Therefore the whole economic structure of the next generation can be really readily viewed in the limited housing selections of the previous generation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Didn't the civil rights era fix everything?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s really marks both an opportunity and a new danger in terms of racial relations in America. On the one hand, the Civil Rights era officially ended inequality of opportunity. It officially ended de jure legal inequality, so it was no longer legal for employers, for landlords, or for any public institution or accommodations to discriminate based on race. At the same time, those civil rights triumphs did nothing to address the underlying economic and social inequalities that had already been in place because of hundreds of years of inequality.</p>\n\n<p>The danger lies in the fact that many white Americans see the civil rights changes as having solved or addressed the racial problem, because it addresses the rules of the game. And many minorities recognize that because the starting line is so different for whites and blacks, it is almost irrelevant that the rules of the game were altered to be more fair. You really have this danger, where there is a complacency about issues of inequality, because we have addressed the official forms of segregation and discrimination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you mean by equality?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's more than one kind of equality. One is equality of opportunity, which means that as long as the rules are the same for everybody, then there is fairness. The motivation for the civil rights movement was really based on achieving equality of opportunity, and this notion of a colorblind society is based on that.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the rules are often bent, if not broken, and you can't talk about having a fair shot in the game if the starting line is staggered. Even if the rules of the game are fair, some people have advantages and some people have handicaps depending on the social position of the families they are born into and what kind of wealth they have, based on past opportunities. This brings us to the second type of equality, and that is equality of condition, which is a more progressive or radical form of equality that doesn't just look at the rules but where everyone is starting from.</p>\n\n<p>The notion of a colorblind society is really based on a mythology - the idea that as long as the rules are fair, we'll have equality. This doesn't recognize the fact that the rewards, the house, the Lexus, you know, the big bank account, those are not only the rewards, the pot of gold at the end of the game, they are also the starting position for the next generation. Until we recognize that there is really no way to talk about equality of opportunity without talking about equality of condition, then we are stuck with this paradoxical idea of a colorblind society in a society that is totally unequal by color.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the wealth gap come about?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's a lot of reasons why there are enormous wealth gaps between minorities and whites in America. The most simple answer is, it takes money to make money. Part of the reason that there's this enormous gap is because whites have long had higher wages and wealth to pass on from generation to generation. And it's like a snowball - it gets bigger and bigger as it gets passed on, and the interest gets compounded. That's partly the reason why the wealth gap has actually increased since the 1960s, since the civil rights times.</p>\n\n<p>But that's not the whole story. There's a long history of exclusion of minorities from wealth accumulation in America, going back to right after the Civil War.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, during slavery, slaves were forbidden legally in most cases from owning anything, including their own bodies. After the Civil War, Jim Crow laws instituted policies such as the Black Codes, which required black entrepreneurs to pay, for example, a $100 licensing fee but required whites to pay nothing. Back in 1870, $100 was basically like a million dollars today. It would shut people out of business. So blacks in the 19th century through that mechanism, and through pure terror, threats of lynching, were precluded from becoming business owners, as one example.</p>\n\n<p>By the 20th century, you had the institution of redlining as a policy in which banks rated neighborhoods for loans based on a four-tier system, red being the lowest ranking that a neighborhood could get. And African American neighborhoods were invariably given this red circle around them, and no loans from private banks would go into that system. That was a policy that was initiated by the federal government and adopted by private lenders.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to the New Deal, when Roosevelt really cut a devil's deal with white southern senators. He didn't overtly exclude blacks from Social Security, but subtly did it by excluding agricultural workers and domestic workers, who were predominantly minorities, from receiving Social Security benefits. This was done explicitly to appease southern Senators, to exclude African Americans, who were disproportionately employed in those two sectors. It wasn't until the Truman Administration that that got corrected. But there's a whole generation of elderly African Americans that didn't receive Social Security benefits, when in fact, it was the biggest giveaway of all, because no one had paid into the system yet.</p>\n\n<p>So you had whites receiving this sort of windfall, and blacks not getting it. More poor black elderly not receiving Social Security means that working families in the African American community have to support them and pay for it. So it's not only an issue of that generation. It trickles down through issues of inheritance and having to support the aged.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward again to after World War II when you have two separate American housing policies. You have this really pro home ownership policy where the government guaranteed low-interest loans for whites in suburban America and helped them obtain wealth. And for minorities you get rental, large-scale, inner-city public housing, which of course is a wealth destruction policy.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1960s there were occasional efforts to foster minority asset accumulation, but they really focused on things like financial skills, and community benefit which was, by definition, nonprofit. These efforts really didn't focus on rectifying the enormous wealth inequalities that had grown up to that point.</p>\n\n<p>Until we correct the fundamental wealth inequalities, these little programs of financial education and other sorts of cultural issues aren't going to make much of a difference, because the underlying economic structure is still unequal.</p>\n\n<p>I also would like to mention, by the way, that savings rates are the same for blacks and whites. That's a common stereotype, you know, of why these gaps exist - the idea that white people save more. And the data show that's simply not true.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But aren't there cultural factors that affect performance and have nothing to do with wealth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many social observers point to outcome differences between blacks and whites, say in education, where the college graduation rate for whites is double that of blacks. Or in occupational achievement, where whites are twice as likely to have a white collar or managerial job as blacks. Or in income, where white family income is on average about double that of the African-American unit. Or family structure, where whites are much more likely than African Americans to delay childbearing past their teenage years and until marriage. In almost any realm of life you can think of, there are racial disparities.</p>\n\n<p>Often when policymakers or social scientists want to compare the outcomes between black and white kids, they'll look at kids who come from families with the same income level. And when you make that comparison, you'll find that there's still a racial gap. People often point to this as something cultural or innate.</p>\n\n<p>But often when we're talking about these racial disparities, we're comparing apples and oranges, because there's still an enormous wealth gap between those families with the same income level.</p>\n\n<p>And I find that when you make the right comparison - when you compare a black kid from a family with the same income and wealth level as the white kid from the similar economic situation - rates of college graduation are the same; rates of employment and work hours are the same; rates of welfare usage are the same.</p>\n\n<p>So when we're talking about race in terms of a cultural accounting of these differences or a genetic accounting of these differences, we're really missing the picture, because we're making the wrong comparison. We're not comparing blacks and whites on an equal footing if we don't take into consideration these wealth differences in addition to the income differences.</p>\n\n<p>So a lot of times when we're talking about race it's really indirectly race. It's that race is associated with these vast income and wealth differences. And that's what's driving these seemingly cultural or behavioral differences in the next generation. The real issue is inequality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don't we just replace race with class then?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the post Civil Rights era it's very difficult to talk about race and class as two separate entities, because they overlap so much in our society. Many things that we associate with race on the surface, like differences in savings rates or differences in education and performance, are really class differences when you get the data and compare individuals coming from similar economic circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>But the complicating factor is that those very economic circumstances are determined by race, through historical inequalities; through contemporary dynamics where whites get jobs disproportionately more than blacks do and other minority groups. So race matters, but it often matters indirectly through the class position, the economic situation of a family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does past wealth help the future generation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As individuals, we like to think that our property is a result of our talent, hard work or even luck - that it's our individual fruits of labor. But economists have shown that about 50-80% of our lifetime wealth accumulation is really attributable, in one way or another, to past generations.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance actually plays a small role in that. What's more common is something like your parents financing your college education, supporting you while you're in school or taking care of you, letting you live with them, while you're looking for a job. It's also little gifts along the way, co-signing the loan for a mortgage, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n<p>All those kind of things lead to lifetime wealth accumulation. And it's this enormous debt we have to our ancestors' wealth that largely explains the perpetuation - in addition to discrimination and government policies - of racial equality in wealth over generations.</p>\n\n<p>So a lot of our wealth comes from our ancestors. Since whites have wealth in their family histories to a disproportionate amount, they're able to confer wealth upon their descendants, and this reproduces racial inequality.</p>\n\n<p>Blacks, on the other hand, tend to have not had wealth accumulation in the past generations for a variety of reasons. But whatever those reasons, even if the current generation makes a lot of money - because there's not also the past wealth to pass on, this racial inequity in wealth gets reproduced generation after generation, and maybe in fact gets worse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the housing market continue to perpetuate disparity?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The housing market is a place where culture meets economics - where values about what people want and where they want to live actually influence prices. Whites control the market by virtue of pure numbers, being the largest group. So when whites want to live somewhere, prices go up, and when whites don't want to live somewhere, prices go down.</p>\n\n<p>If you compare housing in black and white neighborhoods that's otherwise exactly equal - the quality of the housing is the same, the income level of the residents is the same, education system is the same, almost everything is the same - you'll find that the white housing will be worth more precisely because it's white. Because whites are the biggest group in the marketplace, their preferences count the most in terms of supply and demand. So wherever whites want to live, housing values will be high.</p>\n\n<p>The flip side is that if whites don't want to live somewhere, the value of houses in that neighborhood will be less. Think about it: if you have a group that makes up 12-14% of the population like African Americans do - or even 25% of the population if you take the entire non-white population of the United States - they can't compare with the demand created by the other 75-80% of the population, so houses in neighborhoods where whites don't want to live will be depressed by virtue of supply and demand.</p>\n\n<p>The evidence shows that even if a house is in exactly the same condition - it's been kept up at the same rate, the neighborhood is almost exactly the same, but it's black racially - it's going to be worth less money than a similar situated white neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>At one time we had explicit legal racial covenants and/or redlining policies on the part of banks. Today we don't need those anymore, because once we've segregated the market, it becomes in whites' interest to perpetuate the divisions. Whites get a boost in their property values by maintaining a segregation of the marketplace, maintaining their position as the dominant group in the housing market. So once you sort of have the initial push of racial covenants or redlining or any other policy that segregated the housing market, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy after that.</p>\n\n<p>And in fact, there's a vicious cycle here. Because when a neighborhood, a previously white neighborhood starts to integrate, even if individual whites don't have personal or psychological animosity or racial hatred, they still have an economic incentive to leave. Because they recognize that others might make the same calculation and leave first.</p>\n\n<p>And therefore, if there's a rash of selling by whites, which are the biggest group in the marketplace, prices will go down, by virtue of the laws of supply and demand. So you get a vicious circle where whites calculate that other whites are going to sell when the neighborhood integrates. Therefore, they want to sell first to avoid losses, and they actually make it happen - they make white flight happen and drive down property values when the neighborhood becomes more integrated.</p>\n\n<p>It's obviously disadvantageous to African Americans who want to accumulate equity in integrated or in predominantly black neighborhoods. But people don't talk about how it's advantageous to whites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's in it for whites?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The strongest argument you can make to white people is that the current system is not in their own interest, in the long run. The fact is that homeowners and people who have a stake in the American dream are better citizens. So when you systematically shut out a group from wealth ownership, from their slice of the American pie, you're creating an unstable and dangerous situation. You're inviting civil unrest. You're inviting crime. You're inviting a situation where there's incredible tension.</p>\n\n<p>When you have an inclusive society, a republic of property owners where everyone has the opportunity and reality of owning, then you create a stable society where people care about their communities and have a stake in their future. And it's in everybody's interest for everybody in America to have a stake in the future in terms of asset accumulation and economic self-sufficiency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can we do to remedy the wealth gap?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If we want to seriously address the issue of racial inequality in general and wealth inequality in particular, it's going to take dramatic, progressive action. Simply guaranteeing equal access to financial institutions and to housing markets isn't good enough anymore. There's just too much wealth inequality already built up, that the playing field is not level, no matter what you do to the rules of the game.</p>\n\n<p>Of course the most direct way to fix the black/white wealth gap would be reparations - a simple payment of wealth from whites to blacks. That's the most direct, racially explicit way - but probably also the least likely to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Another way is to take redistribute wealth not based on race but in a way that has enormous race effects. Say taxing the wealth of the rich and redistributing it through direct payments or matching savings plans to the wealth poor. It's going to take something along those lines to correct this racial inequity. Just simple equal opportunity won't do it at this point.</p>\n\n<p>I don't expect wealth redistribution to be popular. But it's already going on all the time. It went on in the 1940s and 1950s when we essentially gave away lots of equity in the form of suburban homes to white Americans. It's going on today through all sorts of mortgage interest deductions and corporate giveaways.</p>\n\n<p>It's happening all around us. It's just we don't want to recognize those, because they're benefiting the majority or dominant group of Americans. If we talk about something explicitly to benefit a minority of Americans, people have a lot more problems with that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should whites today be held accountable for things that happened in the past?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Often whites who resist wealth redistribution make the point that, well, my ancestors didn't own slaves; no one in my family was on a plantation, so I'm not responsible for the crimes of history. But the problem with that rationale is it ignores the fact that we're all interconnected and we're all inheritors of the past.</p>\n\n<p>If my family arrived here in the 1920s or the 1960s and is white, I've still benefited from the legacy of slavery. Slavery was the initial push that got the ball rolling and helped generate racial segregation, wealth inequity, inequity in job networks, inequity in housing markets, and so on. The legacy of slavery lives on, because those unequal conditions are still in place, and I benefit as a white person, even if I arrived in 1965.</p>\n\n<p>No matter one's own personal views, you can't escape the larger system in which you're operating. Even if I'm not personally racist or if I can say, Oh, I've got plenty of black friends, I've got plenty of Latino friends. It doesn't matter in the end, unless the overall system has changed, because the question is, How did I get my job? I got my job most likely through social connections, through somebody I know who told me about it and put in a good word for me. And most likely that's somebody white, because whites own more companies and control more jobs.</p>\n\n<p>How did I get to live where I live? I have more freedom because I'm white. I can choose to live in a predominantly white neighborhood, and I can actually choose to live in a predominantly minority neighborhood, without facing the same kind of resistance had the situation been reversed.</p>\n\n<p>So, no matter what your personal views about race are and who your friends are, whites are still advantaged, in an institutional and social way, that often they don't even recognize.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about affirmative action?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People who criticize affirmative action as antithetical to a colorblind society aren't recognizing that we're not in a colorblind society. Already color matters, and affirmative action is just a way to counteract some of those overall trends. First of all, whites and blacks are coming from very different economic circumstances, due to a long history of economic and political exclusion from blacks. Also, there's the cultural and psychological legacy of generations of racial oppression.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people say that affirmative action is problematic because it's giving preference to a single group, but we're doing that already all the time in our \"colorblind\" society. Take the example of college admissions. Sure, there are racial preferences, but those are only meant to countervail some of the more subtle preferences that tend to benefit whites. For example, look at legacies. Kids who have a parent who went to that college have an increased chance of getting into the college. It's an explicit policy among admissions officers. Since whites, in the past, were more likely to have gone to college, especially elite colleges, that's conferring racial advantage, without ever being an explicit racial policy. Affirmative action is one way to counteract that.</p>\n\n<p>Another criticism of affirmative action is that it stigmatizes the group that's receiving the aid. So if a white sees a minority kid in the hallways of Yale or Harvard, they always think, well, did he get in because of affirmative action or does he really \"deserve\" to be here? No one says the same thing about legacies, who get in at a much higher rate. Now, that's because race is something that we can clearly mark or identify, in a way that you can't see whether someone's parent went to Yale or Harvard on their lapel when they're walking down the hallway, as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, it is true that affirmative action as it's currently designed has some stigmatizing aspects, but it can be mended. I think it shouldn't be eliminated, because the absence of it would mean that we're doing nothing at all to level the playing field, when we recognize there's enormous disparities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any personal experiences you draw upon in your work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So much of the discourse about race today is about how race disadvantages minorities. People hardly ever talk about the other half of the coin, which is, How does race benefit whites? And I think it benefits whites in many ways, and some are very evident from my own personal experience.</p>\n\n<p>Having grown up as a white minority in a community of color and in a community of housing projects at that, I'm able to see, in a way that many whites take for granted, the advantages that distinguish me from my neighbors. For example, when my local school deteriorated so badly that my parents had to get me out of there and had no money to move or to send me to private school, they had a friend, a social connection on the other side of town, on the rich side of town, that let us lie to the school board and use his address to say that we were in that school district, and go to a well-funded, well-run school.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's an example of my white privilege because my parents had both the confidence and the sense of entitlement that the system was theirs for the taking. And, at the same time, they had a connection, a white person on the other side of town who lived in a wealthy neighborhood, who let us use is address. So they had both the cultural resources and the social connection that fostered my mobility to a better school district, over and above money. There's a way that race matters.</p>\n\n<p>When I was an adolescent I made a big mistake with a friend of mine after school where I set his apartment on fire. After the fire was put out and the fire marshals and the police came and did their investigation, they decided to let us go. They said, \"You seem like good kids who did a really stupid thing. We'll leave it up to your families to discipline you.\" So this didn't go on my record. I didn't have a mar on my official life history that would have knocked me off the course to college or even worse, have sent me to jail.</p>\n\n<p>I can't be 100% sure, but I'm 99% sure that had I been a different skin tone, or had it been back in my neighborhood of predominantly minority, low-income housing projects, things wouldn't have been handled so informally. I wouldn't have gotten that free pass. And that's one of the major privileges of whiteness that isn't often talked about, but happens to whites in the criminal justice system, for example. We always talk about what happens to minorities, but we don't talk about what happens to whites.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e1364a55-f51c-423a-8ca8-aa358bfcf496","name":"Structured Advantage: Legislation and Government Policy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"87c58c4e-4709-4389-be59-c7380951a2ac","name":"Making Whiteness: Assimilation into Whiteness","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}},{"id":"66d1f34e-1b54-4f88-a147-9a0e19aeac3a","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Housing and Ownership","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}},{"id":"b6696374-c1d9-45c7-b69a-41da2314f0a9","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Intergenerational Wealth and Poverty","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Home Equity","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Segregated Housing and the Racial Wealth Gap","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/d6496c4a4fa69484ccfc4c847216fa83-e219e7eeef7ed6a01062b712d491d368.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"What policies might integrate the suburbs and remedy some of the inequities that stem from residential segregation?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>The racial situation in America is in the interest of those who are racially privileged (i.e., whites) and nowhere does the rubber hit the road more than in real estate.

First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time. And without at least some crude approximation of that, it's extremely hard to make all of these assumptions about what group outperforms another group. It's also not true to fact. Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races. So, to try to make any judgments about one group versus another is extremely difficult when variation is the rule of the game. Abilities change through time. Performance as we see it on the human stage changes through time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess the most important thing to say is that all of this assumes that race is a valid, analytical category. But, in fact, it really isn't a valid, analytical category. Science strives for generalizability. It wants a truth to look for, truths that are true not just for a specific study, but across time, across space. But, as we've previously discussed, race is a category without any sort of central tendency to it. It's a category that is always open to social definition. Always changing through time and place. Who biologically is in a particular race changes over time and over place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the right question to be asking is, what provides for the opportunity of one group or another? We should not assume that perceivable differences are due to genetics. I hope we wouldn't assume today that basic differences in infant mortality between whites and blacks are due to some sort of inherent differences between those two groups that I've just defined by color. Instead, we should look at, what are the social, economic, and political processes that might explain why, at this point and time in the United States, we see such glaring differences in infant mortality between blacks and whites.</p>\r\n","format":"basic_html","processed":"<p>I think there are several faulty leaps of logic here. First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time. And without at least some crude approximation of that, it's extremely hard to make all of these assumptions about what group outperforms another group. It's also not true to fact. Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races. So, to try to make any judgments about one group versus another is extremely difficult when variation is the rule of the game. Abilities change through time. Performance as we see it on the human stage changes through time.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the most important thing to say is that all of this assumes that race is a valid, analytical category. But, in fact, it really isn't a valid, analytical category. Science strives for generalizability. It wants a truth to look for, truths that are true not just for a specific study, but across time, across space. But, as we've previously discussed, race is a category without any sort of central tendency to it. It's a category that is always open to social definition. Always changing through time and place. Who biologically is in a particular race changes over time and over place.</p>\n\n<p>I think the right question to be asking is, what provides for the opportunity of one group or another? We should not assume that perceivable differences are due to genetics. I hope we wouldn't assume today that basic differences in infant mortality between whites and blacks are due to some sort of inherent differences between those two groups that I've just defined by color.

And significantly, the answer to that varies by ethnic group, by a group's particular history in the United States, and even by the period in U.S. history we're talking about. But to bring it up to the present, we cannot generalize about blacks or Asians or Middle Eastern or white immigrants, because their statuses have changed. Nonetheless, there are some things that I would argue are constant. First, the vast majority of immigrants who come to this country do so not just because they want to, but also because they have family, extended family, or other links to immigrant communities here, and those extended immigrant communities provide networks. These networks have access to capital and job markets that help these new immigrants get established and eventually accumulate wealth. Often these localized immigrant middle-class communities can provide connections and opportunities for these newer, equity-poor immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast - and for a number of historical reasons - the black middle class is often not nearly as affluent, nor is their wealth as localized or centralized and therefore cannot provide that same level of support. Furthermore there are simply far more blacks in the United States than there are poor recent immigrants, hence the wealth of their middle-class counterparts is spread even more thinly. This gets back to this issue that is so central to the film series: the long history of the political and economic discrimination against certain racial groups. The black middle class and other minority middle classes are equity poor in large part because of this long history. To this day, it's still comparably much more difficult for certain groups to accumulate wealth. Many immigrants advantaged with easier access to capital through these personal networks are also less likely to be the victims of discrimination by government and private institutions, both in the past and today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it's really important to note that throughout U.S. history, many immigrants have not fared so well. And it's significant to note which groups these are. Hispanic immigrants historically have had a much harder time accumulating wealth than other immigrants, be they European, Asian, or Middle Eastern. Poor black immigrants from the Caribbean, South America, and Africa, have also not fared as well. Likewise, many recent Asian immigrants have come to this country quite destitute, often fleeing political turmoil in the '70s and '80s, and they have likewise struggled in comparison to Asians from other regions, or those who came in other time periods. So I think that if you look at the wide variation in immigrant experience, it provides further evidence that this larger history of discrimination still is a really powerful force. Not all immigrants have been able to establish themselves economically and politically, and more often than not, the immigrants who have generally done best, are those considered white, those who have \"become\" white over time, or those who are considered to be the least threatening to whites in the United States.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n","format":"basic_html","processed":"<p>This is a really big, complicated question.
