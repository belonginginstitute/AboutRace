I think we have to start off first by asking exactly what do we mean by athleticism. Because obviously a lot of diverse characteristics go into that - strength, flexibility, coordination, eyesight, endurance, just to name a few. But, obviously, very different kinds of talents are required in athletes. I happen to have seen a lot of white guys who jump quite well. They're all in ballet, not in basketball.

Does it mean that all blacks are faster than all whites? Well, that's demonstrably false. Does it mean a hypothetical average black person is faster than a hypothetical black person? Well, that's meaningless because I don't know how you'd find the hypothetical average person. Does it mean the ten fastest black people are faster than the ten fastest black people? This is, I think, close to what people mean when they say something like that.

There are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to sports as a vocation. For example, in boxing, there's an overrepresentation of blacks. There's also an overrepresentation of Hispanics in boxing. It's a consequence of the opportunities open to the particular group in question. And where most avenues to upward mobility are closed to you, you're going to gravitate to something that seems just as low a probability of success as anything else.

It's a metaphysical, abstract quality. Ability is something you're born with that is independent of the development you will incur during your life. But the fact is, the only thing that we can measure is what you actually do, how you actually perform. The score you get on a pencil and paper test, or whether you actually shoot ten free throws in a row. And that is not independent of the life history that you have.
