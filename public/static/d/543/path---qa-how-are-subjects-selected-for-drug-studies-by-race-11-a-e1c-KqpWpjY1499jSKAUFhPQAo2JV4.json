Some studies ask where your grandparents were born, for instance. Such studies are really categorizing people according to ancestry, not race. Most studies now, if they're trying to group people by race, rely on recommendations from government agencies. The guidelines suggest that you first ask people a question about ethnicity - are you Hispanic or not Hispanic? - and then ask a question about race. So it's based on self-identification. Participants do have the opportunity to identify themselves as having more than one race, but researchers are supposed to be able to take whatever the research subjects say and collapse that back down into the administrative categories that the government uses, which are White, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black.</p>\n\n<p>This question raises the important point that scientists need to be very clear about who they are studying and why they are studying those particular people. Just because black and white Americans may have \"mixed\" ancestry, does not make all research that uses racial categories invalid. It depends on what the scientist is trying to study. Race is a very, very powerful social category in the U.S., it influences where we live, what schools we attend, what jobs we have, what kinds of stresses we experience, whether we have access to health care, and many other aspects of our lives. Because race is such a powerful social category, it can influence our biology and our health.

Although many people in the U.S. think sickle cell is a disease of black people, that's not necessarily true. Sickle cell is found in people in Greece, the island of Orchomenos, in particular, has very high carrier rates for sickle cell.
