First, all Americans - regardless of socioeconomic status or racial/ethnic background - would need to have equal opportunity to educate themselves, to pursue their professional goals, and to take care of themselves and their families. Second, all Americans would need to rise above the kinds of color-consciousness that perpetuate inequality. Yet there is little evidence, historical or contemporary, that we have met either of these requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Racial minorities have been denied access to jobs, capital, housing and educational resources throughout U.S. history and, of equal importance, are regularly denied access to this day. Institutions - both public and private - have played a critical role in determining which groups have benefited most in U.S. society, often giving whites an advantage at the expense of minorities. And those institutions continue to play this role, despite laws that forbid discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>They continue to play this role in part because of a related, and equally important, factor: Americans are acutely conscious of \"color,\" although they often have very different assumptions about its implications. For example, when nonwhites talk about \"race,\" \"multiculturalism,\" and \"colorblindness,\" they are much more likely to see questions of economic and political power as crucial variables. Whites, by contrast, tend to focus on the issues of \"prejudice,\" \"mutual understanding,\" and \"personal responsibility.\" Indeed whites often argue that if all people could \"look beyond\" race, then \"racial problems\" would go away. This emphasis on \"prejudice\" and \"understanding\" is important. It does not, however, address the role that power relations have long played in racial conflicts in the U.S., and the role that power has played in facilitating whites' relative success in American society.</p>\n\n<p>Why are there such different understandings of the \"difference that race makes?\" It is partly due to the fact that many Americans - especially white Americans - are deeply invested in the idea that individuals (or groups of individuals) are solely responsible for their own success or failure, and thus they attribute success or failure solely to a person's \"effort,\" \"culture,\" or \"values.\" Perhaps if all Americans were to engage in a more concrete, historically informed discussion about \"opportunity\" and \"achievement\" in the U.S., including the role that institutions have played (and continue to play) in shaping people's lives, we might have a very different understanding of \"race\" and its implications.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Dalton Conley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"David M.P.

Cho"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>The question, \"Are we ready for a colorblind society?\" assumes that colorblindness is an ideal we should strive for in the 21st century. I would argue that colorblindness generally perpetuates rather than challenges racism. Certainly there has been a long history of state-sanctioned white supremacy in this country. At one time, colorblindness may have been a legitimate strategy to counteract the formidable power of pseudo-scientific thinking that asserted the inherent biological inferiority of people of color. Today, however, advocates of colorblindness promote an understanding of racial inequality as individual \"prejudice\" devoid of historical context, thus preventing dialogue about more systemic kinds of oppression. The fact that colorblindness is so entrenched in court precedents, legislation, and policy-making testifies to our inability to achieve racial equality while stuck in a pre-civil rights understanding of race and racism.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps opponents of racial equality embrace colorblindness because eliminating race consciousness conveniently eliminates accountability for white supremacy. Witness the latest Ward Connerly incarnation in California: the so-called \"Racial Privacy Initiative\" that would eliminate collection of statistics that use racial categories. This \"colorblind\" initiative would relieve the state of any accountability for racial disadvantage.</p>\n\n<p>Are we ready for a colorblind society?

But they needed labor to grow tobacco, and that tobacco became the support of the colony. Africans were available to provide the labor. They had the skill, by the way, to provide the labor. Therefore, the economic necessity of the time made it easy for those in Virginia and later those in all parts of the colonies, to kid themselves that in some way they were doing something that was not objectionable, that could be rationalized. In a word, we're talking avarice.</p>\n\n<p>For the generations that came afterward and maybe didn't have land or didn't need the labor, it served a different function. One of the things that our concept of race has done is to say to white people at the bottom of American society, you can only fall so far, because race provides a floor beneath which no white person can ever fall. Below this floor there are black people. This is why, for example, non-slaveholders could be convinced by slaveholders to support the Civil War. Because non-slaveholders were told that by supporting the institution of slavery and making sure that institution continues to exist, you can continue to protect yourself from falling to the bottom of southern society, where you will share positions with black people at the bottom of society. So one of the things that racism does is it works to the advantage of those people who are not wealthy and who are not politically, economically strong enough to keep themselves from the lower regions of America's social, political, economic system by, again, providing a floor below which no white person can ever fall. It's a racial floor in American society.</p>"},"changed":1531438883},{"title":"Are we ready for a \"colorblind\" society?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>I hope we're never ready for a \"colorblind\" society.

Perhaps the proper way to address it is to formulate policies based on racism. In other words, formulate policies to address the consequences and not the origins. If you address the economic and psychological consequences of racism, you can in some ways address the problems without addressing race. At the same time, it's often necessary to keep track of racial categories in order to measure the effects of policy. I don't think you can completely throw race out, but you have to use it very cautiously.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be very hard to convince people that as human beings, they will never be conscious of some sort of physical differences between people and create categories in their minds based on perceived physical differences. It's hard to imagine erasing consciousness of what you might want to loosely call \"race.\" But there's a difference between being conscious of race and using that idea in order to create institutional mechanisms that then create unequal social consequences for different groups.</p>"},"changed":1531439185},{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.

The idea of a permanent affirmative action policy is used to scare people who might otherwise support affirmative action. Affirmative action opponents play upon fears that proactive measures will become a politically inscribed remedy that society will never be rid of once they are put into place. Past practice has proven that that's just not the case. At the outset of affirmative action programs, women were incredibly underrepresented in fields such as law and medicine and that gap was quickly eliminated within just a couple of years. Since then, in most programs, women (as an aggregate category) no longer benefit from affirmative action. The same thing happened with various subcategories of Asians at schools in the 1970s.

I think the state of racial politics in this country creates for many privileged people a really significant set of personal and political paradoxes. Most people declare their support for the theory of racial equality: rights and privileges, opportunity, fair treatment. And since the civil rights transformations of the 1950s and '60s, many privileged people, especially whites, think that by respecting the letter of civil rights law and by not engaging in obviously offensive acts of discrimination, they are playing by the rules and promoting equality. Here's the paradox, though: since so many of the mechanisms that discriminate, and so many of the mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are not obvious, many people are actually encouraging and perpetuating this inequality - this same inequality that they claim to oppose. So while many people feel strongly that they are not racist, they nonetheless help perpetuate racial inequality, perhaps unknowingly. That's something people need to think about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does the perpetuation of inequality and the denial that it exists do for political culture and daily life in the U.S.? People of color have always organized to protest against racism, and by doing so they have been instrumental in creating a nation that's actually more fair and democratic. And they're very much aware of the systematic discrimination that still exists. So what happens in political debates and in daily life when whites and others ignore these things, when they insist that there is real equality of opportunity? What happens when people who are in these positions of racial privilege ignore inequality or attribute them to culture or effort? If whites and non-whites, generally speaking, have very different interpretations of the meaning of race in the U.S., it is not a very good recipe for real civic debate and for living in a multi-ethnic or multi-racial country.

First, self-interest: Think of a boiling pot ready to explode. If you continue down this path of wealth inequality and continued hyper-incarceration and other forms of racial oppression, something's going to blow eventually. So, it's in your interest to rectify it. Number two, your sense of efficiency in the free market: We're losing qualified brain surgeons because we're not educating everyone to their fullest potential. Thirdly, the moral argument: What do you believe in?

The whole 1960s notion was about civil rights, not race rights. We have to get back to the idea of a civil society, as Dalton is suggesting. It's interesting - when a lot of people talk about race, they really want to focus on the individual instead of the larger social community. What is the individual's right, responsibility, etc.? But when you switch the terms of debate to something like nationalism or patriotism after 9-11, everyone suddenly wants to talk about community and about collective social responsibility. So there's this weird sort of paradox in terms of when people think of themselves as individuals and when they think of themselves as being part of a larger dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>People also have to recognize that their perception of what's going on is, in fact, very different from the reality of what's going on. For example, an attorney at the EEOC remarked on the fact that the majority of people filing cases of racial discrimination are white. In the vast majority of these cases, they don't win because they mistakenly perceive that they are racially discriminated against when they're not. If you want to enlist the support of white people, you need to get them to realize the position they are in in the first place.<br />\n </p>"},"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"0b5d9d88-1f6f-478c-b931-83f28ab8e394","name":"Structured Advantage: Civil Rights","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"White privilege","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}},{"title":"A Long History of Racial Preferences: For Whites","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>'Colorblind' policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action. But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-coded practices have enabled white Americans.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/ab4690dfbce44c9414a5efd011ceac7e-8fd8740226c51ef8372e0937112a4b0f.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.

I think the state of racial politics in this country creates for many privileged people a really significant set of personal and political paradoxes. Most people declare their support for the theory of racial equality: rights and privileges, opportunity, fair treatment. And since the civil rights transformations of the 1950s and '60s, many privileged people, especially whites, think that by respecting the letter of civil rights law and by not engaging in obviously offensive acts of discrimination, they are playing by the rules and promoting equality. Here's the paradox, though: since so many of the mechanisms that discriminate, and so many of the mechanisms that perpetuate inequality are not obvious, many people are actually encouraging and perpetuating this inequality - this same inequality that they claim to oppose. So while many people feel strongly that they are not racist, they nonetheless help perpetuate racial inequality, perhaps unknowingly. That's something people need to think about.</p>\n\n<p>What does the perpetuation of inequality and the denial that it exists do for political culture and daily life in the U.S.? People of color have always organized to protest against racism, and by doing so they have been instrumental in creating a nation that's actually more fair and democratic. And they're very much aware of the systematic discrimination that still exists. So what happens in political debates and in daily life when whites and others ignore these things, when they insist that there is real equality of opportunity?
