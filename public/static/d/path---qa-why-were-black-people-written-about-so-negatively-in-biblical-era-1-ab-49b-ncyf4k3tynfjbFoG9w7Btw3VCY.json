It dates to the 6th century, not later, and it doesn't reflect negatively on black people. The story of Noah also says nothing about black people. I've read some of the Babylonian material, and I talked with a friend of mine who's an expert on this - these are later interpretations placed upon these original writings. The Biblical story, for example - the suggestion that the curse placed on Canaan applies to blacks - became a rationalization for slavery only during the period of early slavery in the New World. Many descendants of Canaan are in fact described in the Bible as great people. Nimrod, for example, was called a great leader among men.</p>\n\n<p>I think we have to understand that people who are conditioned to what I call the \"racial worldview\" have long attempted to derive their racial attitudes from the Bible, and in doing so they have presented misconceptions and misinterpretations of many Biblical passages. Rarely are people described by their color in the Bible. We don't know what color the Ethiopian woman was who married Moses. We assume she was black, but that assumption was made later in the 18th and 19th centuries. As George says, there was no such thing as the concept of race, and where people use the term \"race\" as a way of translating from Biblical passages, that's a mistranslation. It's a misconception of the meaning of the original term.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"qa-why-were-black-people-written-about-so-negatively-in-biblical-era-1ab","internalComponentName":"ComponentQaWhyWereBlackPeopleWrittenAboutSoNegativelyInBiblicalEra","path":"/qa/why-were-black-people-written-about-so-negatively-in-biblical-era","component":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-qa-js","context":{"id":"02213e19-44c5-4b36-8e3a-706295669652"},"updatedAt":1531342933076,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/eugene/Desktop/Race2/src/templates/qa.js","id":"02213e19-44c5-4b36-8e3a-706295669652"}}
