Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow.

It seems quite likely that skin color is a response to solar radiation - in areas with more solar radiation, people typically have darker skin. Melanin, after all, protects against burns and skin cancer. On the other hand, light skin allows more solar radiation to get through, more vitamin D to be produced, and thus protects against things like rickets in areas of low solar radiation. So different climates produce different environmental pressures, resulting in a tendency towards light skin in some areas and darker skin in other areas. However, there's no real smoking gun here.
