This question assumes that we all have an identity that we use all the time. Therefore, we can go through the process of selecting people who also have similar identities that they use all the time, and these identities can be put into one community of like identities. But the question I would ask is, (1) is there an identity that any person uses all the time, and (2) is that identity race?</p>\n\n<p>First, I think it's absolutely true that people who have similar identities, similar interests, gravitate to one another. For example, I'm a tennis player. When I go on vacation or some place where I know very few people and I see another person who is playing tennis, I gravitate towards that person because it's the thing we have in common. When I lived in Germany, one of the things I did, because my German is terrible, is I tended to gravitate towards people who could speak English. Why? Because we could talk. Some of them were native English speakers; some of them were Germans who spoke English very well. The point is that it was the English, the linguistic part of my identity that we had in common and identified with.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption in this question, which is a bad assumption, is that race is the most important part of a person's identity and that's it's the most important part all of the time. I would argue that that's not true at all. In fact, I would argue that in some cases, race is so far down the line of important parts of your identity that depending on the particular circumstance, it becomes superfluous. One might ask, during the Second World War, when the English faced the Germans, did they say, \"Hey, we're all the same race so we shouldn't have these kinds of problems\"? What about wars in various parts of Africa where people do horrible things to their enemies. I doubt the fact that they were the same race gave them much pause.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null,"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"Similarity/Difference","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Are people who are similar naturally drawn to one another?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>I think the question confuses race and culture.
