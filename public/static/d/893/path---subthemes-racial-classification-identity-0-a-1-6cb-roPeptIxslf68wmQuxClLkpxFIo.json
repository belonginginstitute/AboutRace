Her research focuses on racial inequality without racism and white men and affirmative action."},"field_key_quote":{"processed":"One of the things that surprised me in these interviews is that Americans do not believe in equality. They believe in equal opportunity, but they don't necessarily believe in equality. Americans believe in competition. They believe in rewards for people who try harder."},"field_full_length_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>What inspired your study of white attitudes towards race and racial inequality?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order for me to understand the issues of race in the U.S. - particularly racial inequality - I decided that I needed to understand a puzzling phenomenon: Why is it that the issues of race and racial inequality are so prevalent in public discussion, in news media, in scholarly work, yet when you talk to people about race, no one seems to think there's a problem? This is particularly true among whites.</p>\n\n<p>I often noticed this while teaching a course in business school called \"Managing Diversity in Organizations\" - the class addressed issues of race, ethnicity, gender and other kinds of differences among people in organizations and how one, as a manager, can be effective with diverse work groups. I would present data that showed large differences in income, education and housing among races and people didn't understand the connection. It didn't seem to have any impact on the students, because from the student's point of view, everyone supported the civil rights movement, everyone believed in equal opportunity, no one was a racist, no one was prejudiced. And so I would ask, if that's the case, where is the problem? What are the dynamics that continually reproduce income differences, educational differences, housing segregation, when the people that I talk to don't seem to think that they're part of those dynamics? If white people are not participating in the perpetuation of racial inequality, how is it getting reproduced? I decided to conduct a series of interviews with white people.</p>\n\n<p>So I conducted 246 interviews with white men and women between the ages of 25 and 55, in three areas of the country - in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the South. In each of those regions we identified four zip codes, two that were more likely to be working class areas, two that were more likely to be middle-class areas. And we randomly sampled addresses and interviewed people from each of those zip codes.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to focus on the details of each individual's life histories, starting from high school to the present and get a sense of their decisions and experiences regarding educating and jobs. I wanted to know how people made choices about where they went to school, about how much education they got, what jobs that they got, and how they went from one job to another. So essentially I was trying to understand the life experiences, among whites, that would explain how they got into their current life situations.</p>\n\n<p>And then I also asked a lot of questions about their understanding about what happened in their lives and their views on public policy. I tried to ask questions in ways that did not trigger automatic responses. If you ask people about welfare, affirmative action, poverty, and race, it's likely to induce certain kinds of responses - responses often influenced by what they hear in the news media. So I avoided using those kinds of terms. Instead of asking people about affirmative action, I would say, \"What do you think about the changes that have occurred for women and minorities in education and jobs over the last several decades?\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you think whites feel about race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In general, whites in the U.S. articulate a value system that says that color blindness is a good thing - that noticing race, mentioning race, calling attention to race is a bad thing. And so people would like to think of themselves as colorblind. Most people claim that it doesn't matter if you're black, white, green, purple or blue. What really matters is the best person for the job, the best student for the school, etc. Now, they don't necessarily act that way in their own lives. They in fact do notice race - we have lots of studies that indicate that that is one of the first things that you notice about someone. But the etiology is that it isn't something one should notice, and therefore we aren't going to mention it, we aren't going to talk about it. In fact, whites get very uncomfortable if people call attention to it.</p>\n\n<p>Many studies find that white people know very little about the life situation for black people, except in very general terms. There is a perception that there are some people that have more problems than others, particularly in the inner city among poor blacks. But in general, very few whites have had much contact with or association with blacks up through high school and sometimes even after that. There may be a few black people at school or in the neighborhood or at work - but in general the contact is very limited. So most whites enjoy the privilege or benefit of not having to think much about racial issues except, again, in the abstract - when they see the news media, or when these issues are being framed by the news media or by politicians. Therefore, when they do think about issues, they have very little information to go on except what they have experienced in their own communities on a day to day basis. And so, they make lots of assumptions about the life circumstances for blacks that may not have much bearing in fact.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to generalize white views on race, it would be that they never think about it. They never think about themselves particularly as white, unless that issue is brought to their attention and they're asked to think about it. They know very little about differences among people who are put in different racial categories. And, although they may have strong feelings about the public policies that are supposedly going to address racial issues, they don't actually have much knowledge about what those policies are, how they work, or why they do or don't have certain kinds of effects.</p>\n\n<p>But, they have very strong feelings about how things should work - that color shouldn't matter, that race and gender shouldn't make a difference, that people should be chosen on their individual capabilities or characteristics. I did not find a strong opposition to black people in my interviews. In fact, I found that most of the people I talked to - including those who may have views that might be defined as racist - pointed to colorblindness, civil rights, and equal opportunity as norms that should be upheld.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If so many white people believe in equal opportunity why do racial inequalities persist?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity and that the civil rights movement was a positive thing for the country. They do not believe that they themselves are contributing in any way to these kinds of unequal outcomes. Whites may talk about race, racism and race relations in terms of a collective process, or a community will, but they never applied it to themselves. When people do think about issues of racial inequality, they attribute it to \"those racists over there.\" It never applies to them. They hold onto the notion that racial inequality is created primarily by racism, and if they don't feel that they're racist, then they don't have to participate in a solution.</p>\n\n<p>I learned some unexpected things from these interviews - namely that inequality is reproduced through advantages to whites, as much or more so than it does through discrimination against minorities. While some people make the argument that these are just different sides of the same coin, I will argue that there are very important differences. While discrimination against blacks or other minorities is illegal, favoritism or advantage towards white is not.</p>\n\n<p>Most discussions on issues of racial inequality focus on racism. But whites no longer need discriminatory practices to give them a head start. They have a clear advantage in accessing jobs, good schools, good neighborhoods, and have removed themselves from interactions with minorities. So what is reproducing racial inequality is not necessarily racism, as much as it is a structure or racial privilege that allows some people to be advantaged, and others to be disadvantaged.</p>\n\n<p>Many factors have contributed to this. Segregation in housing allowed most white homeowners to accumulate equity and wealth while most minorities could not. Some people got into schools at times when other people couldn't. Some people got into jobs that paid a family wage with good benefits, and other people didn't. As long as we look for the problem in terms of direct racism or discrimination, we won't see the system of advantage that has perpetuated racial inequalities for generations. Histories of unearned advantages, unequal distribution of resources, the effects of housing segregation, access to job connections - these are the factors that reproduce the unequal outcomes that we see.</p>\n\n<p>There were some people in my study who saw things differently. They seemed to know more about issues of racial inequality, about unemployment, about poverty. What these people had in common was that they all questioned this belief in the American dream. They did not believe that people got ahead just because they tried hard. Most of these people had had an opportunity to see the world outside of their own community or environment. Some had worked in the inner city. Some had been in the Peace Corps. Or maybe there was an incident in their family that had allowed them to see both sides of the fence. They understood that you need resources as well as effort, that you need help as well as talent. They had reframed their understanding of how people got ahead, and saw that it wasn't just up to the individual. They could see the structures of advantage, the structures of privilege, and understood where they were in that process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are whites advantaged in the job market when discriminatory policies have been banned?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Essentially I found that everybody got every job, throughout their entire lives, because somebody helped them. They know someone or they know someone who knows someone, etc. This is so pervasive that I came to understand that almost every job is wired - meaning that there isn't an equal opportunity for people to go out there and compete for a job. Almost every job, in one way or another, is reserved for someone's friend, or someone's colleague, or someone who knows someone, or someone like me.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the people that I talked to are subject to what psychologists call \"attribution error.\" Attribution error has to do with how you attribute the outcomes of certain things. Most people understand what happened in their lives as the result of their own individual efforts, their own personal characteristics, because they were honest, hardworking, tried hard, motivated, able to change, etc. And the situational context - the help they got, the resources available to them, the advantages that they had - are not particularly noticeable to them. In fact, in most cases they didn't offer that information. If they did offer it upon further probing, they would usually minimize it or discount it.</p>\n\n<p>The extra help and advantages were essentially invisible. These advantages would not immediately come to mind when I asked them, \"How did you get that job?\" Many times in the interviews I would have to say, \"Did you know anyone there? Did anyone help you? How did this come about?\" Then people would say, \"Yes, as a matter of fact, I just happened to run into this fellow that I used to go to high school with that worked there.\" He came over and put his arm around my shoulder and said, \"You should hire this guy. He's a good guy.\"</p>\n\n<p>When I asked people what the most important factor was in getting to where they are in life, they would say things like hard work, honesty, motivation, ability to change, persistence. These were all things that they identified as their personal characteristics. It wasn't attributed to someone helping me, my family having resources, someone helping with school tuition or the down payment on a house or car. These facts would be revealed when I asked specific questions, but they didn't see those as important factors.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, having this kind of help or advantage in terms of getting jobs was not just true of the people in fact who had tried hard, worked hard and persisted. It was also true of the people who had screwed up, who had flunked out of school, who had gotten fired from jobs, who had gotten in trouble with the law, who had gotten into drugs and alcohol. Even those people knew someone who could get them back on track, find them a job or at least get them in the door. When I asked them about their particular circumstances, people defined said, \"You know, I got myself together.\" Or they would say \"Yes, that just got me in the door, but then I had to prove myself.\" So even people who objectively didn't necessarily have the qualifications or the capabilities were still able to attain those jobs because somebody helped them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do family resources also provide whites with \"invisible advantages\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I asked people about the resources that they might have had available to them from their families. Did they inherit any money? Did anyone give them money at some point along the way that helped them in one way or another? Initially most people would say \"No, no, no. My family wasn't very rich. They didn't have any money to give me.\" But then I would ask them specific questions: Well, did they help you buy a car? Did they provide babysitting? Did they help you with the down payment for a house? The response would be, \"Yes, they did help me with a down payment, but I paid it all back.\" So in their heads no one actually helped them because quote, \"I paid it all back.\"</p>\n\n<p>But the very fact that someone could hand you several thousand dollars, or co-sign a loan to begin the process of buying a house, is, of course, a significant advantage. But most people didn't it that way. They simply thought about it as a natural thing that families do for each other. They were not necessarily cognizant of the fact that if your own family doesn't own a house, hasn't accumulated equity in a house, hasn't been able to have a jobs with good incomes, they wouldn't be able to provide that sort of help.</p>\n\n<p>Some people ask, \"But, isn't this true for everybody? Don't black people do this the same way? Don't blacks get jobs through friends and through family and so on?\" Well yes, of course that's true. Of course they try to do so. But it's quite clear that because there aren't the same proportion of blacks in managerial jobs, or professional jobs, or good unionized jobs, or good stable jobs in big companies, that there aren't as many avenues for getting this kind of help. So while blacks may try to use the same strategies, they aren't as able to use them as effectively because of the history of advantages that have given whites access to better jobs in better places and bigger companies and better benefits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your discussions about public policy and race, how did whites feel about affirmative action?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's been a great deal of attention to the issue of affirmative action as policy in the U.S., particularly in the last few years with the various initiatives in California, Texas, Michigan and elsewhere to eliminate affirmative action policies. When I talked to these 246 people over the last year-and-a-half to two years, very few people knew the term \"affirmative action\" by name. They knew about it and talked about it, but they couldn't actually identify what it was called. Very few had any substantive knowledge of what the policies meant. They just talked about being against quotas and against choosing someone because they were black as opposed to choosing someone on the basis of merit.</p>\n\n<p>So while there's so much attention to the issue of affirmative action, I found that people knew very little about it - they just knew they were against it. Even though most formed a negative opinion about it, it wasn't an opinion that was substantively linked to what organizations actually do or what the government has actually made legal or illegal.</p>\n\n<p>I asked what they thought about the changes that occurred for blacks in the last couple of decades in terms of their access to education and jobs. Interestingly, most people would say favorable things. They'd say: Great, that's terrific. It's about time. Glad that happened. But then they would say they were against quotas. If there are two people, one black and one white, the black person shouldn't be chosen just because they're black.</p>\n\n<p>That general principle was contradictory, of course, to what happened in their own life stories. In many cases, people went out of their way to help them get in. There was someone in their neighborhood, in their church, in their family, that they went to school with or that they had known from another job, who made an effort to help them get in the door. I call this affirmative inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>So essentially whites are getting lots of extra help, extra privileges, extra advantages. By using the term \"affirmative inclusion,\" I'm pointing to the fact many whites have someone who goes out of their way to make sure that they get included, that they have an edge in getting the job, that they have an advantage.</p>\n\n<p>It's interesting that whites expressed that it is unfair for blacks to be chosen just because they're black, or women to be chosen just because they're women in the same conversation that they revealed all the special help that had gotten in their own life stories. Many whites think of affirmative action as a policy where minorities or women are cutting in line. Meanwhile, I listened to many life stories where friends were essentially saving them a place in line. Somehow, they didn't think of this as unfair. They thought of it simply as someone helping them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>According to your participants, what does it take to be successful in the United States?</strong></p>\n\n<p>An important part of American ideology is the belief in hard work and taking individual responsibility. Most people need to believe that they have done what they needed to and have received the appropriate rewards. One working class fellow talked about getting into a construction unions where his father worked. I asked him if his father hired him. He said, \"No, you don't understand. I was in the union. Nobody gets in the union unless you know somebody.\" Later on he decided he needed a job that was more stable. Some friends that worked at a nearby company told him he should apply. With their help he was able to get that job. Yet when he talked about his life throughout the whole interview he would point to his hands. He would say \"These hands. I did this. Nobody gave me anything. I did this on my own.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another fellow that I talked to, a middle class guy, had flunked out of school, gotten fired from jobs, failed at several businesses, but all through his life someone had helped him get the next job, get the next business, and so on. Yet when he talked about public policy issues, he said the best person should get the job, the one with the highest score. It's not fair if a black person gets a job just because they're black. But in his own life he wasn't the one with the best score, or the best capabilities. People say that they believe in equal opportunity; everybody should have a chance. Everyone should have an opportunity to do whatever they're capable of doing. But according to my interviews, we don't really want equal opportunity. We want advantage and we want our kids to have advantages. They undertake many efforts to try and make sure that their kids can get ahead. This desire for advantage is accepted in our everyday lives but not when it translates into public policy.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of research that shows that people in the United States overall believe very strongly in what's called the American Dream; that anybody can make it if they try hard enough, and that it doesn't matter what obstacles you face. If you have enough motivation and persist, you can get ahead. It's what some psychologists call the belief in a just world. It's important for people to believe that life is the way it should be, because otherwise they may feel very vulnerable and threatened by what could go wrong in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone understands that notion of giving advantage, trying to make sure that your kids have the kinds of experiences that get them ahead. But they don't normally think about that as contradictory to the notion that everybody should have an equal opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that surprised me in these interviews is that Americans do not believe in equality. They believe in equal opportunity, but they don't necessarily believe in equality. Americans believe in competition. They believe in rewards for people who try harder. It's not about making things equal, but how to make things fair. What can we do to make it possible to really believe that people have the chance to get what they deserve, to be rewarded for the contributions that they make, and have the opportunity to develop the talents?</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"b6696374-c1d9-45c7-b69a-41da2314f0a9","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Intergenerational Wealth and Poverty","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}},{"id":"e2b3298a-a33d-4bc3-94b3-0c9a63f7a7c2","name":"Making Whiteness: Whiteness and Class","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}}],"field_tags":null,"field_interviewee":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/daa00fc6ae2a742e39a0d9875f83c18d-50fac4945697c5dbe4c4414e3088adca.jpg","childImageSharp":{"id":"1cf8c073-f763-5c7a-b7b8-931cab9591ac >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1200,"height":500,"src":"/static/daa00fc6ae2a742e39a0d9875f83c18d-50fac4945697c5dbe4c4414e3088adca.jpg"},"sizes":{"src":"/static/daa00fc6ae2a742e39a0d9875f83c18d-50fac4945697c5dbe4c4414e3088adca-381d6.jpg"},"resolutions":{"height":167,"width":400,"src":"/static/daa00fc6ae2a742e39a0d9875f83c18d-50fac4945697c5dbe4c4414e3088adca-10d9a.jpg"}}}}}},{"__typename":"node__interview","title":"Interview with Joseph Graves, Jr.","changed":1530933218,"field_interviewee_name":{"processed":"Joseph Graves, Jr."},"field_interviewee_bio":{"processed":"<p>Joseph Graves, Jr. is a profess of evolutionary biology at Embry-Riddle University, and author of The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium.</p>"},"field_key_quote":{"processed":"<p>The robber barons were the endpoint of what the social Darwinist project was supposed to produce. And poor people or working people were the losers in the struggle for existence.</p>"},"field_full_length_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>What are the conventional notions of race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The average person on the street thinks that race consists of differences in physical appearance, in particular things like eye color, eye shape, skin tone, hair type, and aspects of body stature. They also think that from looking at a person's physical appearance, in the way we just described, that they can find out or know more subtle thing about them such as their potential intelligence or their likeliness to be aggressive, to commit crime, predisposition towards disease</p>\n\n<p>The conventional biologist has a similar, though much more rigorous definition of what they mean by race. Those biologists view race as a subdivision of the human species, that can be consistently defined either by a set of physical characteristics or differences in gene frequencies between those populations, so that the term race in a biologist's sense usually refers to a subspecies level of division. And subspecies are actually groups on the way to forming new species.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what I've pointed out, and many others have pointed out for years, is that race is simply not a level of biological division that we find in anatomically modern humans. There are no subspecies in the human beings that live today. So when we use the term race in the biological sense, there's no scientific support for such groups existing.</p>\n\n<p>Human populations do differ, but they don't differ in the ways that most people think, and they certainly don't differ in the ways that 19th century race scientists thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much genetic diversity exists in humans?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The measured amount of genetic variation in the human population is extremely small, and that's something that people need to wrap themselves around, that genetically we really aren't very different from each other. Most of that genetic variability can be found within populations. For example, about 93% of all of the genetic variability that exists on this planet occurs within Sub-Saharan Africans. So, if there were a catastrophe which destroyed the rest of the world's population, 93% of the genetic variability in the world would still be present in Sub-Saharan Africans.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why we don't define races in the human species is because the within-group genetic variability is greater than the between-group genetic variability. Now, that's an elementary component of any statistical tests. If the within-group variability is larger than the between-group variability, then we say that the groups are not different. Now, the way we measure genetic variability in humans, we can do it at a number of levels. You can even use physical variability, and we still wouldn't reconstruct racial groups. If we looked at even skin color and ask ourselves, \"Does skin color map consistently to racial groups?\" the answer is no.</p>\n\n<p>If we measure protein polymorphisms - that is different forms of a protein produced by a given genetic locus - then we would find that 85% of the protein genetic variability that exists in all humans exists at the individual level. That means that any two people in the world have an 85% chance of sharing that protein variant in common. And we would also find that from 6 to 8% of the remaining genetic variability would be at the level of populations on the same continent, and only about 4 to 5% would be at the level of variation between different continents.</p>\n\n<p>The take-home message here is that the amount of within-group genetic variability, within any group that you'd like to choose, such as African Americans, Hispanics, or Euro-Americans, is much greater than the between-group variation - that is, the variation between African Americans and Hispanics or African-Americans and Euro-Americans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can one define any criteria for racial classification?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think about the characteristics used to define our racial categories. If we were to choose another genetic characteristic, we would redefine all of the people currently living in North America into new racial groups. If we chose, for example, blood type, people could be grouped into O blood type races, B blood type races, and A blood type races. If we chose the ability to taste certain chemicals, we would come up with new races. If we chose whether we have whorls or loops in our fingerprints, we would come up with new races. If we chose lactose intolerance we would choose and redefine new races.</p>\n\n<p>And so the ones that were used to socially define American races were done because of our social and political history, and are genetically arbitrary. If we were to do it on different genetic traits, we would come up with new racial groups.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any correlation between race, genetics and disease?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the most pernicious examples of how the race paradigm has misdirected biological research is in the example of medical research, in which physicians are still convinced that there are such things as the black race, the white race, and the Asian race, and that these groups necessarily have differences in genes that predispose them to disease.</p>\n\n<p>Now the reason that this is believed is because when we look at the records of various diseases in America, there are large differences in the percentage of mortality from disease in the socially constructed racial groups. For example, if you look at the 24 categories that the US Bureau of the Census records data for mortality figures, African Americans lead in 22 of the 24 categories. The only categories that African Americans do not lead in is in accidental death and suicide. So for all of the biological causes, African Americans have between 1.3 to 2.5 times the death rate in all age categories.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this cannot be explained by genetic differences, because if this were due to genetics, we would suppose that African Americans might lead in some, Euro-Americans might lead in some, Asian Americans might lead in some. The fact that there is such a uniform pattern of African Americans dying from these disease categories, such as hypertension and stroke, heart disease and cancer, makes me believe that this is most likely an environmental effect that is superimposed on genetic variation - which still brings us back to the idea of race-specific disease.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at something like, for example, osteoporosis, recently a pharmaceutical company marketed a drug on the idea that because Asian women and Euro-American women have a \"higher risk\" of osteoporosis, that they should take this particular drug, which gave them calcium supplements. Well, the problem with that, of course, is that even though the risk might be higher in those particular populations, there still is a risk to everyone else. And so the idea of marketing a drug on the basis of it helping some groups and not marketing it to everyone, to me, again, is an example of the fallacy of the race concept.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when genetic explanations are raised for specific diseases, most of my students will say, \"Professor Graves, but we know that sickle-cell anemia is something that only black people get,\" and the argument there also is false. The sickle-cell anemia allele is distributed throughout malaria transmission zones, which include central and western Africa but not southern Africa. It also includes the Mediterranean basin, Arabia and India.</p>\n\n<p>And so we can't find any specific disease that is found in any of those socially constructed racial groups, although different local populations may have different frequencies of genes that predispose them for disease, such as cystic fibrosis, which is found predominantly in Northern Europeans, Tay-Sachs, which is found predominantly in Jewish populations from Eastern Europe, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's another way to understand genetic differences?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The best way to understand the genetic differences that we find in human populations is that populations differ by distance. And so populations that are closer to each other geographically are more likely to share common gene variants, whereas populations that are further apart are going to share fewer genes. Human populations differ in gene frequencies relative to their geographic location. And it's a continuous change from one group to another.</p>\n\n<p>And one way we can look at this is use the example of skin color. People in the tropics tend to have darker skin. People in Norway tend to have lighter skin. If we were to only look at people in the tropics and people in Norway, we'd come to the conclusion that there's a group of people who have light skin and there's a group of people who have dark skin.</p>\n\n<p>But if we were to walk from the tropics to the Norway, what we would see is a continuous change in skin tone. And at no point along that trip would we be able to say, \"Oh, this is the place in which we go from the dark race to the light race.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between genes and environment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When we talk about the physical characteristics than an animal or a plant or a person has, those things are the product of genes. But all genes exist in an environment, and the environment always influences the expression of a given gene. Now, there are some genes that we call genes of high penetrance, which will produce their physical feature without regard to the environment we put them in. But most genes are not high penetrance genes. Most gene expression is influenced by the environment, and sometimes we can get radically different physical appearances with the same gene by making small alterations of the environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Social Darwinism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The phrase \"Social Darwinism\" is unfortunate, because it really has very little to do with the ideas of Charles Darwin. It has more to do with the ideas of Herbert Spencer, and also Charles Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Galton.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this idea caught on in America in the latter portion of the 19th century, and it was very popular with the industrial magnates who were changing American society - i.e., the Rockefellers and the Carnegies. And they thought that the person who was successful in business was an example of the end product of a social Darwinist process in which the way we judged an individual's worth was by how well he did in the American economy.</p>\n\n<p>So the robber barons were the endpoint of what the social Darwinist project was supposed to produce. And poor people or working people were the losers in the struggle for existence</p>\n\n<p>Herbert Spencer's phrase, \"survival of the fittest,\" is often mistakenly credited to Charles Darwin. What Spencer meant by that was that an individual who showed the required or desired social characteristics was the most fit in the Spencerian idea of what natural selection was supposed to be. And that's entirely different from Darwin's idea of differential reproductive success of favored genotypes in nature; they're not at all the same. And I often counsel my students that they shouldn't confuse Spencer's ideas with Darwin's ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the origin of eugenics?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Charles Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Galton, was the person who began to put a genetic component onto Spencer's idea of survival of the fittest. Galton reasoned that different types of people had different reproductive proclivities. And what Galton was worried about was that those individuals who were least intelligent and least industrious were the ones who were reproducing the most, whereas the more industrious and more highly intelligent and more socially desirable individuals were reproducing the least.</p>\n\n<p>Sir Francis Galton argued that society should step in, and in particular should support the increased reproduction of those individuals with desirable social traits, and that they should, whenever possible, retard the reproduction of individuals with the least desirable traits. The term Galton coined for this was \"eugenics.\"</p>\n\n<p>The eugenics idea caught on amongst all of the leading Euro-American intellectuals and politicians in America. It caught on amongst right-wing political figures, it also caught on amongst left-wing political figures. The right-wing political figures thought that eugenics programs were necessary to preserve, in particular, the Anglo-Saxon heritage of the United States. The left-wing political figures thought that eugenics was necessary to breed a new type of human being capable of bringing about socialist transformation of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Now, both groups were wrong since behavior doesn't directly code into genes, and it's produced by culture, not by genetic composition. But it was the right-wing political figures like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson who were in a position to influence American social policy. A number of states passed eugenical sterilization laws.</p>\n\n<p>It has been estimated that from the time that the Model American Eugenical Sterilization Law came into existence in the 1920s, that close to 68,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. Probably the best known case is the case of Carey Buck in Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>The most amazing thing about the eugenical sterilization movement is that most of the people who were sterilized were poor Euro-American people who were described as the white trash of our society. Now, the eugenicists didn't bother sterilizing African Americans or Latinos because they felt that these groups were genetically doomed anyway, so there was no need for the state to step in to stop African American reproduction.</p>\n\n<p>The Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor was set up early in the century to create a repository for suspected genetic traits And so they sent out fieldworkers to collect information on various American families and what the genetic traits exhibited in them were. Some of these things were things like the ability to play chess, rowdiness, congenital feeblemindedness, (laughter) virtually any cultural or behavior trait that you could imagine ended up in the trait book at Cold Spring Harbor.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the mistake that they were making was assuming that complex behaviors could be reduced to simple Mendelian genes, one gene produces one trait. And so they thought that by gathering this information on American families they could find out which genetic traits were linked to things like feeblemindedness and other less desirable traits, so that they could then come up with a breeding scheme to help improve the general characteristics of the Euro-American population.</p>\n\n<p>The American social and political elite supported the work at Cold Spring Harbor. They supported it not just in word but in deed. They gave millions of dollars to Charles Davenport's eugenics operation. The best way to think about the activity of the Cold Spring Harbor eugenics record office is that if we were to compare them to the type of scientific research funding that we see today, they would be as well-funded as the Human Genome project is now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the connection between American eugenics and Nazism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Eugenics Record Office was part of an international movement for eugenics in the 1930s. Most Americans do not know that the theories that the Nazi race scientists put into practice were, for the most part, pioneered by British and American eugenicists. And during this time period, there were international conventions of eugenics research in which Americans, Germans, and European eugenicists, in particular Nazi and Italian fascist eugenicists, would get together and talk about both the genetic situation in their countries and the political situation in their countries.</p>\n\n<p>Many American eugenicists were politically in favor of the fascist takeover in Europe, and envisioned similar movements in the United States, such that one American eugenicist actually participated in a Nazi eugenics court, and had the opportunity to comment on the activities of the eugenics examiners. Adolph Hitler and the Nazi propaganda machine pointed out that their eugenic policies were entirely consistent, and in fact derived from ideas of American race scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Eugenics died in the wake of the revelations of the Holocaust, the Nazi atrocities in World War II. It was interesting to note that at Nuremberg, Nazi race scientists who were brought up for crimes against humanity in those proceedings defended themselves on the claim that their activities were only mirroring the state of eugenics science in the world, and in particular they cited the activities of American eugenicists in defending themselves from prosecution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any link between race, genes and athletics?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to start with the idea that many people hold, that there is some special athletic prowess held by people of African descent in America. Most people sort of believe that African Americans are genetically predisposed to being faster runners or better basketball players or for being better cornerbacks in the National Football League. And there's also now some scientific studies which are attempting to look at population-based differences in genes that have to do with various aspects of physiological performance related to athletic ability.</p>\n\n<p>Now, at some level, when we look at human physical variation, there are some differences between human populations that could possibly relate to athletic performance. For example, if we were to look at people from northern climates, who were indigenous residents of northern climates, they tend to be short and stout instead of long or tall and lean. And there are good physical reasons for that. If you evolved in northern climates, like the Aleut or the Eskimo populations did, heat retention is facilitated by being short and stout. If you evolved in the tropics, where the environment is very hot, then heat loss is facilitated by being long and lean. So you're going to see differences in body proportions on that kind of scale.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you were to ask yourself, \"Is it likely that an Alaskan Eskimo is going to become a center in the NBA?\", well, probably not, because height has something to do with your performance at that position in the NBA. So, we can see that in the gross scale it's likely that physical differences may have something to do with various forms of athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>But when we talk about subtle things like, for example, whether a given population is going to be fastest in sprinting, then it's not so simple. The fact is that most of the world record holders in the 100-meter dash are of Western African descent, but they also tend to be African-Americans who have mixed with Europeans and American Indians. So it's not easy for us to determine whether it's being African that might have something to do with them being so fast, or whether it's the fact that they have European and American Indian ancestry that might have helped them be so fast.</p>\n\n<p>And all of those genetic factors have to be tempered in terms of the environment in which individuals train. For example, if you look at those sprinters of Western African ancestry, they all got their records because they trained in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, or even in the Caribbean. If you look at the Western African countries where those sprinters' ancestors supposedly came from, none of those countries have ever produced any world record holders in the sprint events.</p>\n\n<p>So if it was something uniquely about being African that makes you a fast sprinter, then you'd expect that Western African countries would be holding all these records too, but in fact they don't. It has something to do with genetic predisposition, it has something to do with environment, it has something to do with training regimes, and particularly at the level of world-class athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>One of the factors that shows how the situation of populations in different geographical regions influences predisposition for sport is altitude. The Kenyan success in long-distance running may have something to do with the fact that the Kalenjin Kenyans come from a high-altitude region in Kenya. But, Kenyans from low altitudes don't do well in long-distance running, so it's not something special about being a Kenyan, it's something special about living at those high altitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in the last Boston Marathon, which (laughter) someone predicted would be won by a Kalenjin Kenyan, it was in fact won by a South Korean. Now, Korea is also a mountainous country, and so it's entirely possible that this individual at least trained at high altitude. Second place was won by an Ecuadorian, which also is a mountainous country, and they also probably trained at a high altitude.</p>\n\n<p>So we have both short-term physiological adaptation that occurs from training in high altitude, and also long-term genetic adaptations for living at high altitude that might come from populations who live in those regions. And again, none of these things are consistent with our 19th century notions of race, because within the same country low-altitude Kenyans don't do well at long-distance running whereas high-altitude Kenyans do.</p>\n\n<p>So we can't come to any fast, hard rule about how genetic ancestry is going to influence the ability of an individual to perform an athletic event. I think that the simplest thing is to look at the individual's history, how hard they trained, where they got their training, what kinds of resources were put into getting them to be able to participate in world-class athletics, that it's a combination of all these things and that we'll never have a simple genetic answer that says, \"Because you came from this region of the world, you're going to dominate in swimming or long-distance running.\" I don't think we're ever going to have that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do discussions of superior athletic ability always imply inferiority in other areas, like intellect?</strong></p>\n\n<p>American society has created a mythology about the African American male in particular. If an African American male is walking on a major college campus, they are more likely to be thought of as an athlete or a coach of an athletic team than as a faculty member. On my own campus, when I walk to classes, students often come up to me and ask me if I'm the football coach or the basketball coach. And I tell them, \"No, I'm a professor in the department of life sciences.\" And when I come in to teach genetics in the fall, 99% of the Euro-American students in my class have never seen an African American professor teach a science class in the time that they've been enrolled in science courses.</p>\n\n<p>So we have a social history of believing that African Americans cannot perform intellectually. When most Americans see African Americans it's in the context of sports and entertainment. If you look at television shows and the television coverage of African Americans, what most Americans see on the news at night, is African Americans in sports - and unfortunately recently it's been African American sports figures in trouble with the law - and it's been African Americans in entertainment or it's been African Americans in comedy. So we sort of go back to the history of the minstrel show, in terms of the way that the African American is treated in American social life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How have the groups that dominate certain sports changed over time?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the funny things about athleticism and sports is how the expectations of athletic performance change through the years. For example, in the '60s, everyone thought that Africans were fast, and so they expected African Americans to win sprint events, but that the long-distance events were all going to be won by Europeans or Middle Easterners. Then the Kenyans came along and began to dominate long-distance track and field.</p>\n\n<p>When professional basketball first began, one of the best teams was made up of mainly Eastern European Jews, and it was said that the reason why they were so good at basketball was because the \"artful dodger\" characteristic of the Jewish culture made them good at this sport.</p>\n\n<p>There were also, in boxing, at the turn of the century, a lot of European immigrant groups, particularly Irish, who were important in boxing [as well as Jews]. And that has changed. In sprinting, track and field events, it was said that Africans and African Americans were fast and so they could run the short distances but the long distances belonged to Europeans. But then again, the Kenyans came along and blew that theory out of the water.</p>\n\n<p>And so we even see today sports that have been traditionally dominated by people of upper middle class backgrounds, like tennis and golf - the arrival of the Williams sisters in tennis and Tiger Woods in golf - has made some people think that there's something general about being African or African American descent that makes you excellent in athletics.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the history shows us that as opportunities change in society, different groups get drawn into sporting arenas and depending upon, again, opportunity and training, along with individual motivation, that determines who becomes the champion. I don't think it's so much genetic predisposition from some particular region of the world, and certainly it's not race, because as we pointed out in this program that there are no biological races in the human species.</p>\n\n<p>So we have seen, particularly in professional athletics over the last couple of decades, a change in its composition. In the 1950s, social discrimination barred African American athletes from pursuing a career in baseball, in football, in basketball. And now that discrimination has been removed and people with athletic ability of all ethnicities have had a chance to enter sports, and in that time period African Americans now have excelled. Some people argue that this is necessarily a result of the genetic superiority of the African American athlete.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that we don't know this, and, in fact, again, it would be difficult to make that claim based upon all of the things that are required for someone to excel in a given sport. Also, football, basketball, and baseball, are not the only sports in America. If we look at other sports, such as, for example, soccer or lacrosse or volleyball, we don't see African Americans dominating those sports. It takes just as much athletic ability to do well in those sports as in baseball, basketball, and football.</p>\n\n<p>So there are strong cultural aspects of what sports individuals choose to play, along with access and training that have something to do with one's performance. So I don't think we're ever going to be able to isolate the African American gene for athletic performance. I don't think such a gene exists. Given what we know about the overlap of populations and genetic composition, I think it's highly unlikely that that alone would be explaining differences in sports prowess.</p>\n\n<p>It has to do with the interaction of individual genetic background, of opportunity, and training, and I think we should get used to the idea that that's what we're going to know, and we shouldn't be worried about the fact that we can't locate the athletic gene.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your personal experience with regard to racial classification?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, during the census, a census worker came to my house and wanted to take data about the racial composition of the people who lived there.

What are the benefits or the advantages to being white in a society that has historically given benefits and advantages to members of the dominant group? If you are a person who has that privilege, you don't necessarily notice it. It is sometimes taken for granted. Let's use the example of racial profiling. If you're driving on the highway and you are not randomly stopped, you don't get to the end of your drive and say, \"Gee, I wasn't randomly stopped today.\" You just take for granted that you got in your car, drove to your destination, without incident, like you do most days. It's not something that you think of as a function of being a white person in this society, you know?</p>\n\n<p>If you go looking for an apartment and you find the apartment you like, and you rent it without difficulty, you don't say, \"Gee, I benefited from being white today. I got that apartment I wanted.\" If you go shopping in the grocery store and find hair care products and make-up that work for you, you don't think, \"Gee, I'm benefiting from being white today. The hair care products I need and the make-up I want were readily available for me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Can I find opportunities to express my culture if I'm of Asian or Latino descent? How often during the course of a day will I be asked if I speak English, or how long I've been in this country? Will the physical symbol of my face always mark me as a foreigner? These are not things that white people think about on a day-to-day basis - they just take it for granted.</p>\n\n<p>In one of my courses at Holyoke, \"The Psychology of Racism,\" I ask students on the first day of class to get in small groups and talk about themselves in terms of their own racial or ethnic backgrounds. In one of my sessions, that there was a young white woman in a small group talking about these issues, and she was struggling with how to describe herself in terms of her race or ethnicity. Finally she said, \"I'm just normal.\"</p>\n\n<p>When asked what did she mean in that context, she said, \"You know, I lived in an all-white neighborhood. I grew up with people a lot like myself, and I was just like everybody else - I was just the norm.\"</p>\n\n<p>What I think is so significant about her choice of words - to say \"I'm just normal\" - is that it implies that those around you, who weren't from that background, are \"abnormal.\" She never would have said that, but it is embedded in how we think.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does a person support racist systems without being personally racist?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people say \"But I'm not racist. I don't have prejudiced beliefs. As a white person, am I racist, simply because I live in a society in which I'm systematically advantaged?\"</p>\n\n<p>For me the relevant issue is not, \"Are you racist?\" but are you actively working against that system of advantage? Active racism is what I think many people would stereotypically think of as \"racist behavior\": name-calling, acts of racial violence, intentional discrimination, cross burning, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a lot of behavior that also supports a system of advantage that we might describe as passively racist. For example, in education - if I am teaching a course in which I exclude the contributions of people of color, only talk about white people's contributions and only talk about white literature. And I never introduce my students to the work of African Americans, Latinos or Native Americans. I may not be doing that with the intention of promoting a sense of cultural superiority, but in fact the outcome of leaving those contributions out is to reinforce the idea that only white people have made positive cultural contributions.</p>\n\n<p>I know a young woman who went to her English professor and asked, \"Why is it that there are only white writers on our list? This is a 20th Century American Literature course. How come there aren't any writers of color?\" Her professor, to his credit, was quite honest and said I'm teaching the authors I studied in graduate school. It wasn't malice on his part. He didn't wake up one day and say, \"Over my dead body will there be writers of color on my syllabus.\" He was simply teaching the authors with whom he was most familiar.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of individuals supporting racist systems can be found in our lending institutions. I might be an individual loan officer who considers herself to be quite progressive, very open minded; a person with limited, if any, prejudice. And yet I might work for a bank that has the practice of charging higher percentage rates to people who live in particular neighborhoods - specifically neighborhoods that have been redlined. So when a person of color from that neighborhood comes to see me, my own inclination might be to give that person a favorable loan. But if the policy of the bank is to give loans at a particular rate in a particular neighborhood, I might enact that policy, apart from my individual attitude, and in my decision-making reinforce the institutional racism embedded in that practice.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to interrupt these cycles, we have to be quite intentional about it. Even without any malicious intents, such passive acts of giving into certain institutions or traditions will perpetuate systems of advantage based on race.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the obstacles to an equal society? Why can't we be \"colorblind\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Does creating more equitable environments mean loss for some people? That's what the controversy around issues like affirmative action is about. It feels like a loss, people feel like opportunities are being taken away from them. They don't necessarily see that there is a gain for the whole society, and perhaps even for them, by creating opportunities for everybody to contribute more fairly. It's not just about taking things away, it's about creating a better environment for everyone. A safer environment - a more just environment is a more peaceful environment. Martin Luther King said there is no peace without justice. We live in a world that is increasingly torn by violence, not always described as racially motivated violence, but violence which is very much related to systems of oppression. And to the extent that we're able to interrupt those systems, we're able to create a better quality of life for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the problem is that people often struggle with the concept of meritocracy. They grow up with this notion that we live in a meritocracy, that people get what they deserve. It is an idea that has been part of their socialization. And to understand racism, or sexism or classism, or other isms as systems of advantage based on race or social group membership - these really fly in the face of that notion of meritocracy.</p>\n\n<p>Think about the government assistance in home financing that took place for the World War II generation in the 1950's. Who got access to those loans? Where were those new houses being built? In the suburbs. And what resulted from the racially-restrictive covenants that blocked access to that new housing for people of color? If you got a government loan with your GI Bill and bought a house in an all-white area and that house appreciated in value - that was all made more available to you as consequence of racist policies and practices. To the child of that parent, it looks like my father worked hard, bought a house, passed his wealth on to me, made it possible for me to go to school, mortgaged that house so I could have a relatively debt-free college experience, and has financed my college education. How come your father didn't do that? Well, there are some good reasons why maybe your father might have had a harder time doing that if you're African American or Latino or Native American, or even Asian American.</p>\n\n<p>The best response to the colorblind notion I have ever heard came to me from an African American father who I was interviewing for a study I was doing on the experiences of black youth in predominantly white communities.</p>\n\n<p>He was talking about his experiences with his children in school. They were often the only black children in a mostly white class. And he talked about the teachers who would say something like, \"I'm color blind. I treat all the kids the same, all the children the same.\"</p>\n\n<p>And his response was, \"The same as what? The same as if they were all white? My children, as the only black children in the class, are not having the same experience as the white children in that class. The white children are seeing themselves reflected in the schoolbooks, in the classroom teacher. My children are sometimes called names that white children don't hear themselves being called. Their experience is not the same. So for you to say you're colorblind, that you're treating the children all the same, is to say that you're not acknowledging the reality of my child's day-to-day experience, and that feels very invalidating.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Doesn't the existence of multicultural curricula in the United States prove that we're making progress?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We use diversity as an umbrella term to describe the differences among people - whether those differences are cultural, religious, socioeconomic, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, etc. When we think about the benefits of diversity, I think we have to think about the fact that we are not interested in bringing people together just so we can say, \"I know somebody who is different from me.\" It's not just about getting to know people as friends, though certainly there can be very important and useful friendships that emerge in diverse environments. But when I think about diversity and the value of it, I think about really different approaches to problem solving, different approaches to thinking about our society that might lead us to more equitable systems, the various talents that people bring.</p>\n\n<p>In some schools they try to address diversity through what we might describe as a celebration of heroes and holidays. We are going to talk about Martin Luther King in January or February. We are going to have this day where we are celebrating holidays and people are going to bring in foods from different backgrounds, and it's a fairly superficial discussion of diversity, without really engaging in the meaning of that diversity in people's lives.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, as an African American, I might come to school and talk about the holiday Kwaanza as part of diversity celebrations in the school. I happen to be in a family where we do celebrate Kwaanza as well as Christmas. However, if that is all we talk about in terms of my heritage, then I would feel like we had missed the boat. We have to be clear that it's not just understanding that he eats beans and rice, and she eats egg rolls and this person celebrates Kwanza. It's not about that. It is also about understanding the history of the way those groups have been treated in our society, and what we need to do to interrupt that history; to interrupt that current situation in terms of making sure that everybody has equal access.</p>\n\n<p>So it's not just understanding somebody's heroes and holidays, but it's also understanding issues of social justice and how the society operates in ways that systematically advantages some members of our community, and systematically disadvantages other members of our community.</p>\n\n<p>And if we can use our understanding of diversity in those terms and can connect with one another as allies working towards a more socially just environment, then I think we have really maximized the benefit of diversity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does racism affect everyone?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I speak to audiences about this topic of race and racism, one of the questions that I often ask is for them to reflect on their own earliest race-related memory. In general, you can say that people of color tend to have earlier memories - particularly if they grew up in the United States - than those who are white. Having said that, when you ask them what emotion is associated with this early memory, almost everyone, both people of color and white people, will talk about things like fear, anger, sadness, shame, embarrassment, sometimes guilt.</p>\n\n<p>What's really striking to me about this is not only do so many people have this experience, but when asked if they had discussed their experience with an adult or a parent or a teacher at the time, many people said they did not. They already knew that it was a topic you weren't supposed to talk about. Somehow the adults in the environment had communicated to them that this is something we don't discuss. Sometimes the people of color will say I was upset by what happened to me, and I was too embarrassed to tell anybody else about it. Sometime white adults will say that it was a trusted adult who was the source of the confusion. One of the things that makes the process so insidious is that it comes from people we know, love and trust. It's your mother who rented the videotape that was full of stereotypical images. It's your favorite uncle who tells the jokes at Thanksgiving. It's your next door neighbor who makes the casual comments that imbeds. It's your favorite English teacher who leaves writers of color off the syllabus.</p>\n\n<p>What's really significant to me about this is not only that people have these negative experiences, but they've also internalized the idea that we shouldn't talk about it. And that, I think, is really problematic if we are ever going to get beyond the issue of racism as an impediment to social justice in our society because we have to be able to talk about it order to move beyond it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do some people voluntarily separate themselves socially based on race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People are naturally drawn to people who they see as being familiar. However, if you want to connect with somebody who is different from yourself, you have to be able to understand where is that person coming from. And one of the things that I've observed when we talk about, for example, racial group differences, is that students of color often come already thinking about themselves as members of particular groups. Whereas white students don't necessarily come to college thinking of themselves as quote white.</p>\n\n<p>That, I think, is important in terms of how young people are coming together. Because if I'm coming to school thinking about myself as African American, or Latina, or African American, and I'm interacting with white students -- many of whom may have grown up thinking that the thing to do is to be colorblind. And that white student, in her effort to connect with me, says something like, \"Gee, I don't think of you as a black person.\" Or, \"Why do you put so much emphasis on being a Latina?\" Or, \"Why is being African American so important to you?\"</p>\n\n<p>And if that is a very important part of my adolescent identity development process, just asking me that question is going to signal to me that you don't get it, that you don't understand where I'm coming from. Then I have to decide do I want to explain myself to you, or not? I might be willing to explain, once or twice. But if I find that everybody I meet outside of my group needs an explanation, that might get a little old. I might get tired of that.</p>\n\n<p>So I might choose to hang around with people to whom I don't have to explain why I wear my hair the way I do, or why I like to listen to this kind of music as opposed to that kind of music. Or why I speak Spanish on the phone to my mother. That if I don't want to explain certain parts of myself frequently, I might choose to hang around with people who are similar to me. And that's an understandable response.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, identity questions really start to come to the surface during adolescence. That's when young people really start to think, \"Who am I? What do I want to be when I grow up? How do I want to interact with other people in the world? Who do I want to connect with?\" All of these are questions about identity.</p>\n\n<p>But when you talk to young people of color, many of their identity questions are linked to their sense of themselves as members of a particular racial or ethnic group; not only who am I, but who am I as an African American woman? Who am I as an African American male? Who am I as a Latina? Who am I as a Cherokee? When you talk to young white people, they may be thinking about who they are and who they want to relate to, and how they want to think about themselves in the world. But it may not necessarily be linked to their sense of what it means to be white - particularly if they've grown up in a predominantly white community, or gone to predominantly white schools.</p>\n\n<p>Now you might ask why do so many young people of color think about their racial group membership? If white kids aren't thinking about it, why are kids of color thinking about it? And one of the reasons they're thinking about it is because other people bring it to their attention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do cultural influences (television, media, etc.) make whiteness the norm and people of color \"the other\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Certainly if we're talking about white people living in predominantly white communities, it is certainly true that many people will grow up without having direct contact with people of color. And because they don't have that direct contact, the information that they have is coming to them largely from second hand sources; maybe from the television they've watched, the movies they've seen, the jokes they hear people tell, the casual comments they hear relatives making. So that the information is coming in stereotyped packages, typically.</p>\n\n<p>One of the problems with stereotyping and the self-fulfilling nature of it, is that if you've heard these things, and then you meet somebody, you are likely to look for those characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly if we think about how young children begin to understand race and the images that they are exposed to, we can say that white children receive many images in which they see themselves reflected. Their parents go to the library, they check out library books, and they see white children in them. They watch television, they see white children playing. Which is not to say they never see messages or images of people of color, but they're seeing lots of white images -- not only on television but in their homes, in their families, in their neighborhoods. So as a consequence of that, they will tend to think of white as the norm.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that we know about white children is that they often express curiosity about that which they perceive as different. You know, the white child in the grocery store who might see a dark-skinned person for the first time saying, \"Mommy, mommy, why is that person so dark?\" They're not asking, \"Mommy, mommy, why are we so light?\" The question is framed in terms of the other.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, young children of color growing up, even if they live in environments that are fairly homogenous - black kids growing up in black neighborhoods, Latino children in Latino neighborhoods, etc. - are going to also be bombarded with images of white people in the media, in the books they get from the library, in the television they watch. So that even though they may be surrounded by a community in which they see themselves reflected, in terms of the bigger society, they, too, are also watching the same television programs, reading the same children's books, exposed to the same curricula in school, etc. So children of color don't necessarily start out asking why do white people look the way they do, but why do I look the way I do? Young children come to understand the wider world in terms as one that is dominated by white people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can we have control over racial stereotypes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"The Lion King\" was a very popular film, and my kids saw it more than once, I will confess. However, when I watched it with them, I pointed out some concerns I had. I told my children that I was bothered by the fact that the hyenas - who were the bad guys of the film - have voices that make them sound like black people and Spanish speaking people. Now, some people would say I'm making too much of that. But think about the fact that young children watch movies like this repeatedly and these messages are seen over and over again. They do have an effect on how we view others.</p>\n\n<p>Now, am I saying that you should never let your children see a film that has a stereotype in it? No. What I'm saying is that you need to help your kids think critically about them so they can recognize them as stereotypes and think critically about whether they make sense or not.</p>\n\n<p>Once, while we were driving through a city not far from where we live, my son saw a young black man running down the street. He said to me, \"Why is that kid running?\" I said, \"I don't know why he's running. Why do you think he's running?\" And my son said, \"Maybe he stole something.\" And I was horrified to hear him make that comment. Where would he have gotten that idea?</p>\n\n<p>So I said, \"Well, what would make you think so?\" He said, \"You know, we're in a city. Sometimes people in cities steal things.\" And I pointed out that we have been in the city many times, parked our car, and never had a problem. I've had one thing stolen from my car in my life, and that happened in the small town, predominantly white, in which I live now. Well clearly he sees the nightly news. He watches television. He had absorbed those messages.</p>\n\n<p>Books, computer games, the Web, television - there are so many places that we can be exposed to stereotypes, that we can be exposed to distorted information. And there is a whole universe of information that we're not getting. Think about these stereotypes, these omissions, these distortions as a kind of environment that surrounds us, like smog in the air. We don't breathe it because we like it. We don't breathe it because we think it's good for us. We breathe it because it's the only air that's available.</p>\n\n<p>And in the same way, we're taking in misinformation not because we want it. When you or your child sits in front of the television on Saturday morning watching cartoons, you're not saying let's have our daily diet of stereotypes today. But you're being exposed to them because they're just there, in the commercials, in the images that you're watching. And it's so pervasive that you don't even notice it sometimes. In fact, a lot of the time you don't notice it.</p>\n\n<p>We're all breathing in misinformation. We're all being exposed to stereotypes, and we all have to think about how we have been impacted by that. You sometimes hear people say there is not a prejudiced bone in my body. But I think when somebody makes that statement, we might gently say to them check again. That if we have all been breathing in smog, we can't help but have have our thinking shaped by it somehow. As a consequence, we all have work to do. Whether you identify as a person of color, whether you identify as a white person, it doesn't matter. We all have been exposed to misinformation that we have to think critically about.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e9b26778-9258-4a2a-92bb-5f31268bf578","name":"Structured Advantage: Institutional Racism","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"White privilege","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}},{"title":"A Long History of Racial Preferences: For Whites","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>'Colorblind' policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action. But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-coded practices have enabled white Americans.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/ab4690dfbce44c9414a5efd011ceac7e-8fd8740226c51ef8372e0937112a4b0f.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.

Actually, a new study of incarceration and race shows that one in eight black men between the ages of 20 and 40 were jailed last year, in comparison to one out of 63 white men from that age group.</p>\n\n<p>Now, most revealing here is that the greatest increase in incarceration has come from the war on drugs. Something like three quarters of the half million people jailed for drug possession are black or Latino, despite the fact that rates of drug use are about the same in all ethnic or racial groups. Whites use drugs just as much as others do. I came from a relatively affluent white community where lots of kids were doing drugs, but they weren't going to jail for many years for it. Rarely did these white kids or adults get caught, and when they did, they benefited from lenient policing or from different sentencing practices.</p>\n\n<p>In the media, you often read about this issue of single-family parenting and the importance of nuclear families. There is a lot of attention paid to these issues in terms of cultural difference. Yet as The Economist recently reported, western Europeans register higher rates of out-of-wedlock parenthood than do African Americans. Yet this phenomenon gets special attention only in the latter case. Furthermore, there's no evidence that people raised in what are commonly referred to as \"nuclear families\" actually fare better in absolute terms than those who grew up in more extended families. Despite a long, long history of African Americans' deep commitment to their families, both immediate and extended, there's this popular political discourse about how blacks lack family values; that this has been a major cause of poverty.</p>"},"changed":1532734255}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}}],"field_interviewee":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408.png","childImageSharp":{"id":"42a48b8c-e394-5f83-b503-798cf42893ec >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1148,"height":1076,"src":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408.png"},"sizes":{"src":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408-2fd78.png"},"resolutions":{"height":375,"width":400,"src":"/static/439e8b1583e7fabbd4c74e1718d8d3c0-d724a929363a147e5c38a9eb9c1b7408-37095.png"}}}}}},{"__typename":"node__interview","title":"Interview with john a. powell","changed":1531977002,"field_interviewee_name":{"processed":"john a. powell"},"field_interviewee_bio":{"processed":"<p>john a. powell is director of the Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in the Americas at Ohio State University and the Gregory H.

I watched my mother and father struggling to hold the family together and trying to get housing, and I remember the frustration. And then watching the city starting to die, and literally watching the complexion of the city change. I remember moving to an integrated neighborhood that within a few years became an all-black neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>I also remember being bussed to school, and fighting on the playground because the white kids didn't want us there. I have all these memories. At first they were just experiences, and I didn't quite know how to make sense of them, and didn't necessarily think of them in racial terms, but as I got older and reflected on them, I began to understand.</p>\n\n<p>One of my most poignant memories - I have three older brothers - we all went to the same high school, and they were all excluded from sports, from college prep courses, and from the social activity of the school. I'm a lot younger than my brothers, so when I went to the school I decided - I didn't use these words then - but I decided to crack the color line.</p>\n\n<p>I decided I was going to go to be in college prep and play sports, and it was a fight. The school was about 50 percent black, and 50 percent white at Southeastern High School in Detroit. I had the facility to test well, so I tested well before I went to high school, and I said I wanted to go in for college prep. I had good grades and high test scores, and they said, \"No, you do not belong. This is not appropriate.\" I had to bring my parents up to school in order to get into college prep, and even though the school was 50 percent black, for most of my high school, I was the only African American male in almost all of my classes, and literally had teachers say in class, \"Do any of the colored kids want to wash my car after school?\"</p>\n\n<p>I graduated valedictorian, number one in my class, and our school was sort of a feeder school to elite schools: Harvard, Yale, Michigan. I had a hard time getting teachers to write me recommendations for the top schools. They thought those schools were above me. They thought I should go to some of the local schools, to Wayne State or Eastern Michigan State, but certainly not to the elite schools.</p>\n\n<p>So, there were just a number of experiences that as I reflect back on and sort of start to understand in deeper terms, I think had a huge impact on my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is race socially constructed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you think about the United States in the 1700s and 1800s, who was black or not was a matter of state definition. You could be black in one state, cross the state line and you're no longer black. Some states said if you look black, you're black. Some states said if you have one-quarter black blood, you're black. Some states said if you had one-sixteenth black blood, you're black. Some states said if you have one drop of black blood you're black, so if it was simply a biological fact you couldn't have all these different ways of thinking about race.</p>\n\n<p>Since race is constructed, it's constructed differently in different places and in different times. For example, in the Dominican Republic, children with the same biological parents can be of a different race. That's not possible in the United States, but there a light-skinned child of the same biological parents can be white, and a dark-skinned child with the same biological parents can be black. You have a similar situation in Brazil. Again, it just shows how the way different countries and different people do race changes.</p>\n\n<p>There's this curious thing about the way we've defined race in the U.S., where a white woman can have a black child, but a black woman can't have a white child. Obviously that's a social construction; it doesn't make any sense biologically. Throughout U.S. history, the way we've talked about race has shifted over time.</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing about race is understanding not just a categorization. It's about where you are in the social strata - how you're categorized has tremendous social significance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If race is socially constructed, why can't we just get rid of the concept?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race may be socially constructed, but it's not individually constructed. Individuals have some impact on how they're viewed, but we don't get to define our own racial identity. In the United States, race has been so important in terms of constructing identity that to be an American, early on, really meant to be white. It had religious connotations; it had class connotations; it had connotations of where you could live, who you could marry, where you could be buried, how you were educated.</p>\n\n<p>The mistake that we often make now, as we talk increasingly about race being socially constructed, is that some people think because it's socially constructed it's not real, and that an individual can choose his or her own race.</p>\n\n<p>I can't decide today not to be black, because the world will insist that I am black, and there are institutions and arrangements that define me that way. I can't decide not to be black and go in New York and hail a cab. The first cab drivers driving by are not inside my own psychology. So, the construction of race is extremely important, but it's not individually constructed; it's socially constructed, and that has material implications and consequences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do institutions construct race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Early on, who could serve on a jury in the United States? The courts ruled that blacks and Indians could not serve on the jury. So, you had an institutional practice, and it didn't depend on individual identity. Someone labeled someone else as black or white, and then institutions created certain responses to that.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people don't realize that one of the reasons we have an electoral college and one of the ways it was set up was to protect slave states. It gave slave states more voting power; it counted slaves as three-fifths of a person. We forget that slavery is not something that just impacted the South, it impacted the whole country. Also, slavery was limited to blacks, so it became very important how you were categorized. And the presumption in this country for many years was that blacks were not free, even if you lived in a non-slave state. Certain rights were associated with certain people, and the institutions reflected those rights.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the structures and institutions we have in place today have come out of this racial history, and they continue to subordinate blacks and protect the privilege of whites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the stories about race we tell now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think there are a number of stories. I think one is individuality, that we're all individuals. I think another is a culture of poverty. People are uncomfortable now with the biological explanation for racial difference, so now people talk about the culture of black people to explain why those people don't do well.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the language of personal responsibility, which suggests really that there's no institutional and structural responsibility. There's no collective responsibility. If you're not doing well, it's not because of anything that we in society have done. It's not because of our history, our legacy of Jim Crow, segregation, exploitation and subordination; it's all personal. So it all gets translated into, \"We're not responsible.\"</p>\n\n<p>I think another really powerful story that has been prevalent in the United States since the mid-1970s, is white innocence. If you go back and read the Bakke case - which was a court case about affirmative action - Bakke started off as a case about blacks being excluded from schools, about the subordination and discrimination of blacks. By the time the case ended, it was about innocent whites, so the whole language now about doing anything to address inequality in this country always runs up against the question - what about innocent whites?</p>\n\n<p>I ask my students sometimes, how did those whites become innocent? If we mean innocent in the sense that they didn't deliberately and intentionally participate in the subordination of blacks and other peoples, maybe they're innocent. But if we mean innocent in the sense that they haven't received any of the spoils of a racialized system, then no American is innocent.</p>\n\n<p>But that's the major storyline now on race. Yes, racism is a problem, but the victims of racism are these innocent whites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is whiteness socially constructed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think that's a very important question, and a very interesting question. Basically the idea of whiteness is who is included? Who's part of the family? And it has material consequences. And how that's done changes over time. At one point, we had explicit laws that said whites are on top, and blacks are on the bottom. There was a huge social distance between blacks and whites.</p>\n\n<p>After World War II, we moved to informal exclusion of blacks, and that was partly because of the tension around World War II. We formally ended Jim Crow, which created that social distance. Now what we do is we create spatial distance. So geography, the segregation of blacks and whites in terms of neighborhoods, in terms of cities and suburbs, took on the primary function of maintaining that distance.</p>\n\n<p>There are no explicit laws now that say blacks can't live in a certain neighborhood, which was true at the turn of the century in Baltimore and other cities. We actually had cities passing laws saying blacks and whites could not live on the same block, or saying that blacks could not hold jobs over whites. Today, we have many of the same practices without the explicit language, and those practices are largely inscribed in geography. And so, geography does the work of Jim Crow laws.</p>\n\n<p>Many people are confused as to why, after 50 years of civil rights, are our schools still segregated? Why is our housing market still segregated? Why are our jobs still segregated? And again, a lot of this is a function of how we've created urbanized space in the United States.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does geography do the work of Jim Crow laws?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the 1940s and 1950s the whole country was living in central cities or in rural areas. Suburbs as we know them hadn't come into existence. There was a tremendous demand for housing at the end of World War II, and the federal government stepped into the breach, and stepped into the role of addressing the demand for housing, as it also stepped into the role of addressing the demand for civil rights and inclusion by blacks.</p>\n\n<p>In creating the suburbs it was explicit that the suburbs were for whites only. You had a couple of things happening at the same time: You had the end of the war. You had blacks coming to the North and to urban areas in record numbers. You had demands for civil rights, and you had the federal government essentially paying white people to leave the central city and to live in this new space - a white space - called the suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of that is still what we're living with today. So much of the work of Jim Crow laws was maintaining social distance between blacks and whites - it was not necessarily physical distance before the turn of the century, especially in the South. But that social distance became reinscribed as spatial distance between blacks and whites as a result of the housing policies after World War II. Now whites lived in the suburbs, and blacks and racialized others lived in the city. Social differences became redefined through these fragmented, racialized, metropolitan areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the government create spatial distance?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all, in the 1930s, in order to buy a home, you had to put between 20 and 30, sometimes 50% down to buy a home, and you had to pay off the loan in five years. In the 1930s, this was the middle of the Depression, and consumers were losing more homes than they were buying. The federal government stepped in, and created the first serious national program around housing. So it started making money available, and then later it insured private investments.</p>\n\n<p>But in this regulation - this was the Home Owners Loan Corporation and the Federal Housing Administration - the government basically said that it preferred neighborhoods that were racially homogeneous and newly constructed.</p>\n\n<p>The cities were already built. So where do you get new construction? It means you have to leave the city. Where it says racially homogenous, it didn't really mean racially homogeneous; it really meant white, and it described neighborhoods that were black as a nuisance, in the same way that pig pens and stables were. So money was divested from the central city, which were old neighborhoods and where blacks were more likely to live, and suburbs were created.</p>\n\n<p>Up until then suburbs had been largely the homes of the well-to-do. All of a sudden, it became cheaper to buy a home in the suburbs than to rent a place in the city. But this venture for acquiring a home was only available to whites. So it redefined the racial geographic space in the United States in a fundamental way, so suburbs became associated with whiteness and cities became associated with people of color.</p>\n\n<p>The national purse was put behind this game at the very time that blacks were making demands for inclusion and to end the Jim Crow laws.</p>\n\n<p>Very little government funding was given to people of color. In fact, there are a number of cases where whites who wanted to get FHA loans were told by the federal government, the only way they could do it was if they put racially restrictive covenants in their deeds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the federal government help individual homeowners?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What the FHA and the federal government did was to tell lenders that if you will lend to buyers, we will guarantee 90 percent of the loan, so people only had to put 10 percent down. The government would buy loans from lenders, so one bank wouldn't have to carry the loans for thirty years or five years. It helped stabilize the banking industry.</p>\n\n<p>After World War II when veterans started coming back to the United States, 16 million of them, they lowered the rate to 3 percent down or even nothing down. It made the buying of a house for the first time accessible to most Americans.</p>\n\n<p>It made the whole industry accessible to middle class Americans, but only middle class white Americans, because only white Americans could get the high rating and the best rates, based on the government appraisal system. So this housing boom that took off after the war was something that was largely for white Americans, and not black Americans, or to some extent even Jews.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's the significance of Levittowns?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Levittown is like the equivalent of the T Model Ford. It made housing available to working class America. It made it cheaper to buy than to rent, and it gave people a chance to get out of the city into the suburbs. And it happened at the time when there was a tremendous pent up housing need, because we were just coming out of World War II.</p>\n\n<p>But it's also very racialized. Levittown required restricted covenants in its deeds. He was explicit. He was not going to rent to blacks, he was not going to sell to blacks. He'd grown up in Brooklyn, where blacks had moved in, and he didn't want to live around blacks, and didn't want his business to be about blacks. And so, until 1960 82,000 people lived in Levittown, supported strongly by public money - which meant not just white people's money, but black people's money - and there wasn't a single black person living in Levittown.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did creating suburbs drain resources out of the central cities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the 1950s something like 80 percent of the building that was happening across the country was happening in the suburbs, so all of our national resources were going out of the central city to support white folks moving out into the suburbs. Now, some of those white folks moving out of the central city were happy to live among black people, but the federal government and certainly Levitt refused that. They said, no this will be a white space. In fact, Levitt evicted some white people who wanted to attract and open up housing to people of color.</p>\n\n<p>So this fundamental framework was established - not just of having white suburbs and concentrating minorities in the central city, but also depopulating and depleting resources for the central city and creating this division between the suburbs and the city. And, I would say, redefining whiteness in a particular way. A good neighborhood became a white neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting thing about Levittown is the uniformity of housing. Because it's mass-produced, all the houses looked exactly alike, and it was actually heavily regulated what you could do in terms of your house. You had to get approval from Levitt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Were people of color completely left out of the housing market?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Blacks weren't completely left out of the housing market, but the housing market they were exposed to was largely public housing. Public housing, first of all, was built almost exclusively - with a few exceptions - in the central city. And after World War II, we started building larger and larger public housing projects, which are called \"vertical ghettos.\"</p>\n\n<p>All of a sudden you're concentrating large numbers of poor people of color in one place, and then in the '50s and '60s, there's also this idea of clearing out places where blacks had lived before. Some people called it urban renewal, other people called it urban removal - we removed whole neighborhoods and sometimes these neighborhoods were very vibrant. We'd run a freeway through the middle of it, and they would build these giant erections in the central city.</p>\n\n<p>This is a time when, also, the country was going through the beginning of \"de-industrialization,\" where jobs were moving out of the central cities. So we're isolating people away from the tax base, from good schools, and from jobs, and really building ghettos for black people.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this was a federal program, but it was administered through local control, so each community had complete control over whether or not to build public housing, and how to build public housing. And it's not surprising that many of the suburbs - in fact, most - said no, we do not want any public housing. We do not want those people out here.</p>\n\n<p>And the federal government said fine. Even though we're the federal government, even though we have the right to exercise control over the federal purse, we will do it in a completely fragmented way that will give each community a veto over who can live there. And that's still the way we operate the federal housing program.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What were the consequences of this new housing policy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the consequences of creating these new home ownerships for millions of white Americans while redlining black America was to create wealth in a racialized way.</p>\n\n<p>You had a dual housing market - one white, one black - one housing market with a lot of demand; another housing market with very little demand. My family, like a lot of families, was in Detroit, struggling to buy a house, and Detroit was a very tight housing market. There was no housing to be had. Eventually, my parents bought a house, but they bought a house in the city. They couldn't get money to refinance that house.</p>\n\n<p>My father still lives in the house that I grew up in. That house today, a five-bedroom house, is worth about $20,000. That same house bought in the suburbs would be worth today about $320,000.</p>\n\n<p>So whites moving to the suburb were being subsidized in an accumulation of wealth, while blacks were being divested. As a result, there's a huge wealth differential between blacks and whites in this country that's largely associated with housing. The majority of Americans have their wealth in housing, and because the housing stock was so incredibly racialized, it created tremendous wealth in the white population and very little wealth in the black population.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does wealth translate into life opportunities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's hard to overstate how important wealth is. We live in a capitalist society. Often, we focus on income or how much money somebody makes, but really the thing that buys opportunity is wealth. If you make $100,000, and you have $120,000 worth of debts a year you're in trouble. So, you really have to look at disposable income or wealth.</p>\n\n<p>It's not just individual wealth; it's also collective wealth. If you live in a community where the whole community is poor or strapped for money, it can't buy the amenities; it can't make the kind of difference. Traditionally, blacks have been located where there's high need and very few resources, while whites have often been located where there are low needs and high resources. Given a choice, most people would prefer to live in a place where there are higher resources and fewer needs. That choice simply has not been available to blacks.</p>\n\n<p>Where you live also determines what kind of school your children are going to go to, whether you're going to be close to transportation, and whether you're going to live next to a toxic dump site or not. There was also a recent article in the New York Times about heart attacks - it showed that where you live, what kind of community you live in, has a tremendous correlation with whether or not you have a heart attack.</p>\n\n<p>So, the way space is arranged actually impacts our health and opportunities in fundamental ways, and wealth is one of the best indicators of that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't people self-segregate by choice?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hundreds of polls have shown that most black Americans prefer to live in integrated neighborhoods. Yet blacks have been consistently, since the turn of the century, the most segregated population in American history. The reality is that housing choices for African Americans are incredibly frustrated by the whole system - whether it's not being able to get adequate financing, steering, or existing segregation.</p>\n\n<p>In 1970 there was a crack in this. In 1968 we passed the Fair Housing laws, and since 1970 black have been suburbanizing at a faster rate than any other population in the country, and especially middle class blacks.</p>\n\n<p>But what you see happening is really the same phenomenon over and over again. Blacks will move to a suburb and after you get to a certain number, whites start leaving in droves. And when they leave, they don't just go anywhere; for the most part they go to new white enclaves. So, it's not a matter of choice, certainly not on the part of blacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But we've all seen communities decline after minorities move in. How do you explain that phenomenon?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the things about understanding racism is to understand it has a material reality. We're giving these storylines around those realities, so we have to sort of think about both the story line and the material reality. An example of that is housing value.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every person that I know, especially every white person I know, has a story about having grown up in an area that was very nice, and then blacks moved in and the housing value going down. So the story that gets told around that is when blacks move in, housing values go down. That's confirmed by lived experience, and it gets retold over and over, so virtually every white person knows this story.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to suggest is that that story is true, but not for the reasons that the story suggests. It's not that blacks move in that causes the housing values to go down, it's that whites leave. Instead of focusing on the white flight, they focus on the black entrance.</p>\n\n<p>But when whites leave, because blacks only represent about 4 percent of any housing market, it means you have a housing market in which 96 percent of the market isn't interested, and that causes values to plummet immediately. But it's the white flight that's causing housing values to plummet, not blacks moving in.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there have been a few communities, including Oak Park, outside of Chicago, where they watched this phenomena of blacks starting to move in. Oak Park is a liberal community that fought for the civil rights movement. In the late '60s, when blacks started to move in, the residents said, you know what, this is all the equity we have. This is all the wealth that we have. I'm concerned that housing values are going to go down. I know that same story. But it's not because we're afraid of living next to black people, we just don't want to lose our wealth.</p>\n\n<p>So what the city did was insure the value of the houses - up to 85 percent of market value - so whites wouldn't feel forced to leave. That was about 35-40 years ago. They haven't paid one casualty and it remains a very vibrant, integrated community, because whites didn't flee.</p>\n\n<p>So that's the phenomenon - that white flight is actually a self-fulfilling prophecy. By leaving a neighborhood and refusing to stay where blacks are, that causes housing values to go down, rather than the black presence itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aren't whites the most segregated group?</strong></p>\n\n<p>White communities are certainly the most isolated. But there's different ways of thinking about segregation. When you think about segregation just as separation, yes, whites are the most segregated. But when you think of segregation as what one community imposes on another, then in that sense whites are not really segregated. They live in enclaves. Blacks are not imposing that on them.</p>\n\n<p>But the black housing experience and to a lesser extent the Latino housing experience is something that's imposed by whites. It's public policy being used to control and regulate minority space, and at the same time the same policies and regulations are used to enhance white space.</p>\n\n<p>So, there's a difference. There's a lack of symmetry that's important to keep in mind. Because when whites are all by themselves, they're taking all the resources with them. They're taking all the amenities with them. But when blacks are by themselves, they can't get loans, they don't have a decent tax base, there are no jobs, and because they don't have a decent tax base, services are underfunded, and all that becomes associated with black space.</p>\n\n<p>People will say, \"I remember when Newark was a working city, and now that black people live there, it doesn't function.\" Well, they don't realize that the whole structure of the city has been eroded, and no matter who was there with that structure, you couldn't make it function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some difficulties in addressing inequality?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this country we have an ambivalence about wanting to hold on to an ideal - the notion of equality - but not in such a way that it fundamentally changes white privilege.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the ways that we've thought about race, and certainly the way we think about it now, is that the country is basically fine. So whites can say, \"I'm for integrated schools, but I don't want my children going to integrated schools. I'm for the idea of integrated schools. I like that idea, but I don't like the reality.\"</p>\n\n<p>So you get this sort of ambivalent response - we'll embrace the idea, but we will not embrace the reality. At the same time, the government, if you will, is responding to a lot of conflicting demands. But what's important in part, is that, as a response to these matters in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, some of this stuff is explicit.</p>\n\n<p>Now it's sort of hard to believe that the federal government nationalized and introduced red lining, that it divested funds from the central city, and reinvested in the suburbs. This wasn't simply whites acting out their prejudice; this was the government essentially telling people how to behave, and it created this whole structure that we're still living with.</p>\n\n<p>In a funny way, it wasn't just giving something to whites - it was constructing whiteness. In the past white had meant being a citizen and being a Christian; it now meant living in the suburbs, and this essentially didn't change in terms of practice until almost the 1970s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should whites be held accountable for what was done in the past?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot of white people say, well, you know, I don't want to hear about slavery - you know, I had nothing to do with that, and my parents came much later. They don't realize that even for them to be able to come was part of the racialized system, but the fact that they could come to the United States was already a benefit of being white, because if you're Chinese or if you're black, you couldn't come.</p>\n\n<p>You don't even have to be aware of it to receive the benefit. And the thing that's really slick about whiteness, if you will, is that most of the benefits can be obtained without ever doing anything personally. Take the suburbs, for example. If you live in the suburbs, growing suburbs, you're going to get a huge economic windfall. You're going to accumulate wealth. Whereas, if you live in the city, the same investment, the same household, you're not going to get that.</p>\n\n<p>That's part of being white. The benefit of suburban living is to be able to accumulate wealth; associated with that, of course, is that you live in an area where you accumulate wealth, and your kids can go to a school that's functioning.</p>\n\n<p>And so there are a whole set of assumptions that flow from being white, just like there are a whole set of benefits that flow from being male - you know, being a man doesn't mean that you have antipathy toward women, but if society is patriarchal, which a lot of people say it is, it means that the way resources are distributed in society benefits men.</p>\n\n<p>In that sense, men are not innocent, even though they may not personally have antipathy toward women. In the same way, in that sense, whites are not innocent. They're given the spoils of a racist system, even if they're not personally racist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is whiteness invisible?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The invisibility of whiteness means that one doesn't have to notice that one is white. A wonderful example of this is the recent controversy over network television shows, which generally have nearly all-white casts. When asked, the producers and directors said, we didn't notice that there were no people of color involved. It was absent from our eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, when one goes to any place of privilege - whether it's Harvard or Stanford, an investment bank, or Wall Street - most of the time people will not notice that all the people, or the vast majority, are white. If they're not white, they do notice. So, whiteness doesn't call attention in a way. It becomes the norm. Those are just people.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes reading the newspaper you'll notice the same assumption: they'll say, so and so did such and such. No description in terms of race. But so and so, a black man, or this other person, a Latino woman - that person has to be described. They're not just a person.</p>\n\n<p>So there are people, and then there are black people. There are people and there are Latino people. And people - just people, just folks - turn out to be white, but we don't notice it. We don't read it. And that's how society responds.</p>\n\n<p>You know, in one of her early snips Supreme Court Justice O'Connor made the observation that, of course, this is a white country. So, if this is a white country, what does it mean if you're not white? What is your place? And who gets to decide? Who gets to give meaning?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is essentially white people. White people sort of explain other people. You know, we have white people writing about black people; white people writing about Native Americans - not Native Americans having their own voice.</p>\n\n<p>But that's starting to change. And whites are starting to be racialized for the first time. They're starting to experience a racial identity, because the sort of normalcy of whiteness is being called into question. There's nothing normal about it. It's constructed just like every other racial identity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When do whites notice race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>White people have the luxury of not having to think about race. I don't believe many black people have that luxury. That is a benefit of being white, of being part of the dominant group. Just like men don't have to think about gender. The system works for you, and you don't have to think about it.</p>\n\n<p>So they live in white space and then they don't have to think about it. But when that space is interrupted or challenged, they notice it. When a black or a Latino or sometimes an Asian crosses a border line, whites notice it, often in violent ways.</p>\n\n<p>On a day-to-day basis if whites are in white spaces, they don't have to think about it, but when they notice all of a sudden I'm in a black space or the blacks are in white space - they notice it very strongly. So I think that there are very clear radars out there, sort of policing space, if you will. Most whites, if their kids come home and say, \"You know what, Mom? I'm marrying a black woman,\" they would notice it.</p>\n\n<p>That question of how whites think about race - first of all, they don't think about it in terms of themselves; they think about race as something that belongs to somebody else. The blacks have race; maybe Latinos have race; maybe Asians have race. But they're just white. They're just people. That's part of being white.</p>\n\n<p>Just think of when John Kennedy ran for President. There was a huge discussion in the Presidential debate: can a Catholic be President? All of a sudden we noticed the boundary. We never said, can a Protestant be President?</p>\n\n<p>So those boundaries get policed, and many of the fights, many of the struggles around race, are struggles around the boundaries. As long as each group stays comfortably in their space, there's no struggle. It doesn't mean there's equality. It doesn't mean there's justice, but there's just no struggle. The boundaries are where we see those struggles occur.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things is that the boundary is also spatial, so when people from the \"city\" start coming to the \"suburbs,\" all of a sudden that boundary becomes contested. Frankly many whites, if they can't control those boundaries, they'll move and redefine the boundaries and borders, and again try to create enclaves.</p>\n\n<p>One of the fastest growing housing trends in California, for example, is the gated community. Well, that's a clear exercise in boundaries. We can't depend on the municipal government to keep those people out; we'll build a moat around our community, and we'll make sure that they stay out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should a white person be concerned about their advantages?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For whites, there are a number of advantages to having a racial system. It certainly benefits them. But it also hurts whites. For example, most whites are socialized to believe that to come to the city is a dangerous thing. I think that to have to cut yourself off from humanity, and have to, in essence, police another part of humanity, puts both - I hate this term - puts both the master and the servant into a very particular relationship, in some ways a very dehumanizing relationship. So we're not equal and it may be better to be the master than the slave, but it would be better to be neither.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said earlier, I do believe that whites have ambivalent attitudes. I believe that most whites would like for us to move toward a more just society, a more equal society.</p>\n\n<p>White attitudes are changing all the time. If you look at 1950s attitudes towards integration versus today - the majority of whites today say they'd prefer to live in an integrated neighborhood and send their kids to integrated schools. What they mean by that is a different question, but also the world and demographics of the country are changing, and to live in a white enclave is not to live in the world. And I think, you know, it has a certain deadness to it; it has a certain spiritual corruption to it.</p>\n\n<p>I think that most people - white, black, Latino, and otherwise - would like to see something different. We just don't know how to do it, and we've been so entrenched in the way things are. It's hard to imagine the world being different.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do our stories about race reinforce inequality?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One way of thinking about the construction of race is to think about, What does race mean? If it doesn't mean biology, if it doesn't mean genes, what does it mean? And largely it means status. It means privilege. It means the ability to make meaning of things.</p>\n\n<p>We all know about good neighborhoods, right? Well, good neighborhood is a euphemism; it's code for a white neighborhood. So we use neighborhoods and we use boundaries to construct what's associated with whiteness. Ultimately, it's not just the distribution of a benefit to whites; it's also the distribution of identity to whites, and neighborhoods or geographical space with all the benefits and detriments flowing from them. It's very racially coded in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>There's tremendous inequity in our society. You go to schools, even schools that are quote unquote integrated or desegregated and you see the students in college prep and AP courses are generally white. You go down to the basement where they're doing remedial courses, and those are the students of color. What do you do with that?</p>\n\n<p>In a sense we need help. We're given a storyline to help make sense of it - basically an explanation that make us comfortable with it. And the explanation has to put the blame on those who are in the basement, put the blame on those who are homeless.</p>\n\n<p>They're homeless because of some defect or some failing of their own, some moral or bad decisions. It has nothing to do with you and has nothing to do with the way we've ordered society. Because if it does have something to do with you and the way we order society, what's called for then is examining, restructuring society, and that is what we're not willing to do.</p>\n\n<p>So these storylines help us make sense of a world where's there's tremendous inequality, tremendous disparities, yet we still want to hold on to the idea of equal opportunity and fairness. How do we do that? Well, these stories help us do that.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it's clear to me that they way we do race will change in the next 20 years. I'm not sure how it's going to change, but it's going to change. What we're watching is a new racial making - how we will construct the racial identity of Latinos in this country, and what will happen, also, to the racial paradigm in this country. It's clearly under some pressure to change, and change usually happens based on pressure.</p>\n\n<p>If Latinos are excluded from all of the benefits associated with whiteness, they will not be white. If they're included in those benefits, they will be white. It's not - we can't look at their skin color or even their heritage to say if they're white or not; we have to see how these institutions respond to them or not. If they don't respond to them, if they remain non-citizens or provisional citizens like blacks have been, they will not be white.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wouldn't it be better not to call attention to race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The story line about these difficulties is basically to try to transcend race in a personal way - the color-blind myth, the everybody's an individual myth.</p>\n\n<p>Some people say that to talk about race is to talk about racism, about white supremacy. In a way, if there's a disease, it's not necessarily dependent upon your recognizing it for it to flourish. If in fact, as I argue, racism and white supremacy are embedded in institutional structures of society, not seeing it is no great service, because it will reproduce itself unless it's disrupted.</p>\n\n<p>We tend to conflate racism with prejudice, so if a person doesn't want to own any prejudice, which I think is great, it doesn't mean you're dealing with racism - you know, the fact that certain populations get loans from banks, and the other populations don't. The fact that we live in space that's racially coded and coded in terms of opportunity is powerful. That's not changed by simply saying, \"I'm not going to see it.\"</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in order to address it you have to see it. You have to notice the difference in order to address it.</p>\n\n<p>Worldwide, women control less than 1 percent of the wealth of the world. Now, many people probably don't see that. Unless that's disrupted, women in the world will not have equality. And it doesn't mean that a man who doesn't see that carries personal animus; one of the problems is that we've psychological - so we think if I fix my psychology I've dealt with it.</p>\n\n<p>It's not a psychological thing. That's only a small part of it; it's embedded in our structures, our institutional practice, and unless we notice it in all those places, we can't really address it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What would you say to someone specifically who says, \"Why should I care?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I mean, there are many things. For example, social security - you know, we're sort of all worried if there's going to be enough money for social security. I think of the social security crisis as a race crisis, because what we have are a lot of aging, white baby boomers who will retire in 15 years, and they'll be dependent upon a black, brown, and Asian workforce to support them. There's a relationship there. Basically, as a country, we're going to say to young black workers, young Latino workers, \"Tax yourself at a very high rate, so that older white people can be comfortable.\" It's not clear they're going to do that, especially if, as a society, we haven't cared about them.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, some people might say, well, I'll live in an enclave, and I won't have anything to do with those angry black and Latino workers, but then there's still the question, \"Who’s going to turn our decaying bodies?\" It's those same black and brown workers in the healthcare industry who are going to be needed to care for the aging whites.</p>\n\n<p>We are all connected in fundamental ways. Racism is not just about keeping someone a stranger. It's about a set of relationships. Those relationships exist, and if they're unhealthy, it means the whole society is unhealthy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can we do about these existing inequalities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What we do matters, and that's the good news. Unfortunately, right now, I don't think we're doing very much - that's the bad news. But racial demographics are changing, and we talk about that a lot. Unfortunately, though, we talk about it as if racial categories and the way we do race will stay exactly the same, except we'll add different numbers, and it's clear to me that that's not going to be the case.</p>\n\n<p>It's not going to be simply an increased number of blacks Latinos or Asians in the population. One of the questions will be, what do those terms mean? What does it mean to be black? What does it mean to be Latino? What does it mean to be Asian?</p>\n\n<p>I think the real challenge is, are we willing to really notice race where white supremacy reigns? We can try to change race a number of ways. We can follow the Brazilian model and have many more categories, with whites still the dominant group, and blacks still the subordinate groups.</p>\n\n<p>Or we can really disrupt race fundamentally, where you can no longer predict access to power and wealth and privilege and meaning, based on race. You can no longer predict spatial meaning based on race. That to me would be much more interesting, and that future is possible, but only if we're willing to first notice it, and then try to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you see the most hope?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I see hope in the changing demographics, not just in the United States, also in the world. I think globalization will have a huge impact on how we think about and do race in the world. We've always been interconnected, but I think there's going to be some challenge to change those connections, and to use each other, to rely on each other in interesting ways.</p>\n\n<p>I see hope in the change of personal attitudes, but also, as I suggested earlier, sometimes that's unfortunately all we're willing to work on, and we're not willing to look at the structural arrangements. I don't think that most blacks, and probably most Latinos and Asians buy the dominant story line in this country.</p>\n\n<p>For me, no matter how many ways you cut it, the tremendous disparity between blacks and whites is a problem. You can say it's blacks fault, it's a culture of poverty, it's the history of slavery - whatever the reason, it's a problem that I think has to be addressed. And some of that requires institutional change and institutional making.</p>\n\n<p>I think we have to be uncomfortable with the present racial arrangement. Many of the stories that we tell now are really designed to make us both comfortable and feel powerless. In a sense, I think we have to be willing to be uncomfortable, willing to demand more of ourselves and more of our country, and willing to make the invisible visible; willing to make the structures that support the system to be able to put them on the table, and engage in real examination of those.</p>\n\n<p>I think out of that comes the impetus, the motivation to do something about it. And when we have a vision that will take us there, then we have to be willing to look at what's impeding that vision. This huge racial disparity - we have to be uncomfortable about that.</p>\n\n<p>We are already uncomfortable in some ways, but the stories we're told, the stories that we tell ourselves are designed to help us be comfortable, to disempower us. \"Oh, the poor will always be among us.\" \"Oh, this is a matter of choice.\" \"Oh, this is a matter of cultural poverty.\" \"Oh, they just commit more crime.\" All of those are designed to really say, \"It's not my problem.\"</p>\n\n<p>I think we have to reject that. We have to be willing to sit with the discomfort, and to examine what can we do to not be comfortable but to call the world to being that we all want to live in.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e2b3298a-a33d-4bc3-94b3-0c9a63f7a7c2","name":"Making Whiteness: Whiteness and Class","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}},{"id":"b6696374-c1d9-45c7-b69a-41da2314f0a9","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Intergenerational Wealth and Poverty","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"One-drop rule","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Slavery, and the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/9ce2075939e2d48f0db2848fde0b0af5-9972893df12cce8eba77938c24d03308.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"White Supremacy","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"The Hispanic Color Divide","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>John R.

I think that one step towards enlisting people who might lose some of their privileges is to get them to consider this paradox and the impact this paradox has on the culture and politics of race relations in their daily lives.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think that people in positions of relative privilege, especially racial privilege, need to initiate debates over racial equality.

Race was about a racist system of supremacy in which one group dominated the other.</p>"},"field_full_length_version":{"processed":"<p><strong>What's the big deal about classifying people into different racial categories?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race was never just a matter of categories. It was a matter of creating hierarchies. Race was about a racist system of supremacy in which one group dominated the other. And I think that when we look at the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries the key moment where race becomes congealed as a system is where we can see the creation of a color line.</p>\n\n<p>Race, or the creation of racism, was really about the invention of a dominant group. In this case the dominant group were the slave owners - the dominant group were those who conquered the world - the Spanish, Portuguese and English. And here you get the emergence of this idea of a white race, you know a kind of pan-European white race. On the other side of that color line are all these different groups: indigenous peoples, Native Americans, Africans, Asians, who then get marked as something different and combined.</p>\n\n<p>So in India for example, in the 19th century, or 18th century, the Indians would be considered black in some ways by the British. They are not exactly the same as the Africans, they wouldn't be conceived the same way, but they ultimately would be placed on the other side of the color line. And so that is where the binary begins.</p>\n\n<p>Native Americans in North America for example, were the enemy. They were the Other - the ones who had to be conquered in order for Manifest Destiny to expand across North America. And they end up being lumped together with Africans, with Asians. So I guess what I am saying is that even within the categories of non-whiteness, you may have all these multiplicities, all these specific groups. But they still get lumped together as one, that is \"nonwhite.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was unique about the situation in North America that led to race as we know it today?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well it is an interesting question because you can go back to Ancient Greece and you can see the development of categories and hierarchies where the ancient Greeks may think of the Persians as barbarians.</p>\n\n<p>But something changed in the 17th and 18th centuries. And in some ways the creation of these new racial hierarchies were tied directly to the emergence of a New World economy. It's tied directly to the creation of a world system of slavery, the enslavement of Indian populations in Mexico, and the enslavement of Africans in Brazil and North America. You have a moment historically when Europe is expanding across the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Yet that expansion of Europe is also tied to a moment when all of Europe is inspired by democratic revolution, inspired by the Enlightenment. The potential for a world where, at last theoretically, everyone is equal and free - where liberty is the catch word of the day.</p>\n\n<p>The problem that they had to figure out is, how can we promote liberty, freedom, democracy on the one hand, and a system of slavery and exploitation of people who are non-white on the other? How can we do this?</p>\n\n<p>Remember, initially in the early stages of colonial America a lot of those poor whites and indentured servants who worked alongside Africans on early plantations and farms in North America, they rebelled together. Sometimes they took to arms such as in Bacon's Rebellion, sometimes they formed Maroon societies in which Native Americans and Africans and renegade whites ran away together and formed colonies to defend themselves against slave masters.</p>\n\n<p>But ultimately the way for the planter elite to undermine that potential unity among the renegade whites and the Africans and Native Americans was to begin to pass laws which created a very strict racial hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>The first set of laws were laws that made African slavery permanent. In other words you were property until death. They distinguished that kind of permanent slavery from indentured servitude, which was a limited amount of years and after that you are free.</p>\n\n<p>Other laws were passed against interracial marriage. Interracial marriage and interracial relationships had been fairly common in the early part of the 16th and 17th centuries. By the late 17th and early 18th century a lot of that stuff was outlawed. There were laws passed which promoted harsher punishment for Africans for crimes versus white Christians.</p>\n\n<p>And that in some ways helped destroy any potential for unity across those color lines and made the line sharper between black and, white, or white and other.</p>\n\n<p>And here you get the formation of a really foundational system of racism which was necessary in order for America to become both a democracy on one hand and a slave state on the other.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, another problem is that the way liberty really gets translated in real life is the right to own property. And if you have liberty rooted in the right to own property, that includes the right to own slaves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did early American peoples see themselves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind in this early period of 17th century America is that blackness and whiteness weren't clear categories of identity. When Africans came here they came to the New World not as black people, not as Negroes. They didn't see themselves that way. They saw themselves according to their own sort of ethnic identities. The same with the Europeans. They were Portuguese, they were English, and Irish.</p>\n\n<p>So you have a situation in which alliances are formed on these new plantation economies and in the new town of the New World in which sometimes being Irish was close to being Ibo. Sometimes people met together in taverns and bars who were considered sort of riff-raff, the lower classes, and they were a mix of different people across racial lines.</p>\n\n<p>Over time those alliances were broken up, and as the alliances were broken up, it became clear that many of the European-descended poor whites began to identify themselves with, if not directly with the rich whites, certainly with being white. As a way to distinguish themselves from those dark-skinned people who they associate with perpetual slavery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To what extent do we make our own racial self-identities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between racial identity imposed upon people like a marker, like a brand, versus a self-formed identity. And of course these things are connected but there is a distinction.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of black people you could see the evolution in how they saw themselves from their own ethnic identities to a pan-African identity, to maybe seeing themselves as part of a larger solidarity with other people from the African continent.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you look at the history of black naming of the 19th century you have names like African, Afro-Saxon, Anglo-African, colored, free people of color, Negro, and each one of these self-named identities are saying something about the relationship to the larger world.</p>\n\n<p>And when black people early in the 19th century stopped calling themselves African and began calling themselves Negro or colored American, it was to make claims upon citizenship. It was to say look, you want to send us back to Africa, and even though we may feel ourselves of African descent, we want to claim American-ness, claim \"colored American,\" claim \"Negro,\" in order to support our claims to being in this country.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing with Asian identities. In the 19th century you don't see people self-identifying as Asian because they were tied to very specific nationalities. A pan-Asian identity is a modern thing. It is a modern 20th-century notion which is intended to build solidarity against racism and for a broader pan-Asian culture - a new kind of culture in some ways.</p>\n\n<p>And that is why we can never talk about identities as fixed, they are always dynamic and changing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To what extent is racial self-identity a negotiation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My whole life is a personal experience about understanding racism. Every day as a black person in this country I am reminded that I am black. But interestingly, this is a world where even the definition of blackness is multiple and complex, so I get these questions: \"Are you Puerto Rican?\" \"Are you Dominican?\" \"You must not be from the United States.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you don't talk like those southern Negroes.\" There is a whole range of ways in which blackness gets marked. The same with whiteness.</p>\n\n<p>And so I think that one of the things that young people need to always realize is race is this dynamic process of identity formation and reformation where the identities that you cling to are made within the context of other people making identities and imposing them on you.</p>\n\n<p>And so sometimes just the resistance to someone else's identity imposed on you itself becomes a new identity. And that is why so much of anti-racism in America is about overthrowing stereotypes but also finding ways to celebrate what is distinct and unique about us as a community. No matter what that community is.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it is about building communities that didn't exist before. You know, there is no necessary reason why people from North Africa and Morocco, or the Gnawa people of Morocco or the people of the Congo should necessarily be united as one community. Yet it is precisely racism that produced the circumstances for that basis of unity. But there is also more than that. It is also the recognition that there are certain cultural elements that we share as a community, certain values that we share as a community, which lay the foundation for new identities.</p>\n\n<p>And that is what is so tricky about it. When you see those new racial identities you have young people who say that that itself is a racism. And I think that is a mistake. It is a mistake to argue that in the context in which we live that we can't form new identities because I think the dream that everyone has is a moment in which we not only recognize the dynamism of identities but we can all see ourselves not as one group, but as multiple groups that can share and exchange ideas from one another so that we can always be changing, and always become something different and yet never lose the sense of difference and community and individuality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does the one-drop rule develop in North America?</strong></p>\n\n<p>North America is unique because it had this one-drop rule. That is, is if you have any African ancestors that makes you black. And of course it is not the same in every state. And it is unlike the Caribbean or Brazil or other places.</p>\n\n<p>Now why is this the case in North America? That is the question. In part, it's because every slave society had to have a buffer class. In the Caribbean, which had a 90 -95% African-descended population, that buffer class was the mulatto group.</p>\n\n<p>In North America you had a buffer class of poor whites. And as long as you had that continual immigration of poor whites, white working-class people in North America with limited privileges, that class that would always oppose these Africans.</p>\n\n<p>And so therefore every single person of African descent in a multiracial culture like North America would be considered not only black, but would be considered potential slaves. In a system where slavery is generational, the offspring of interracial relationships could then be enslaved and so the slavemaster wouldn't lose his property.</p>\n\n<p>And even if they were free they would have limited access to citizenship and democracy. So laws were passed that limited their movement or access to rights and privileges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Enlightenment science affirm ideas of race?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another reason why the context of the Enlightenment is so important to race is because this is when the idea of science is being invented. And what ends up happening is that science becomes a challenge to Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>Biblical ideas basically suggest that everyone evolved from Adam and Eve. And if that is the case, the only way to explain 'racial' difference is the climate - that old idea that a temperate climates produce superior people and that hot climates produce dim-witted people but for different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>What is interesting is that the Enlightenment produced a challenge to Christianity. And what ends up happening is scientists begin to talk about the races as separate human species emerging over time.</p>\n\n<p>And when you can talk about different species, it solves the problem of saying that we are all part of the Christian world. It allows you to begin to designate some people as just one step out of the animal kingdom, in the case of Africans. It even allows you in some ways to talk about the noble savage in the case of Native Americans, who are celebrated in some ways initially as having a certain kind of superior primitive knowledge that could be liberating for the West.</p>\n\n<p>Now what is also interesting is that science in the 18th and 19th century requires a rewriting of the histories that they already knew in order to justify these claims. Perhaps the best example is that in the 19th century, ancient history gets rewritten so that the connection of Egypt and North Africa to ancient Greece gets erased. Almost all historians who write histories of the formation of Europe and Greek lineage begin to literally, systematically remove the present of Egyptian philosophers.</p>\n\n<p>And of course we think of this as a small deal. But it is a huge deal in terms of the way that these new regimes could justify the idea that Africans are perpetually, intrinsically and inherently inferior to this new group we call Europeans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why didn't we do away with racism after slavery?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Post-Civil War Reconstruction represents one of those moments when I think racism might have been overthrown - one of those roads not quite taken.</p>\n\n<p>After Emancipation, all these freed African Americans began to build institutions and homes and communities. At the end of the Civil War, the first task was to reconstruct the South, to reconstruct democracy. The Republican Party consisted of some poor southern whites, African Americans, and northern radicals who were committed to a new democracy. And together they passed laws and produced a vision of society in which everyone would have a right to land, everyone would have the right to free universal public education, everyone - at least all males - would have the right to vote. And as a result of Reconstruction, many poor whites who couldn't vote before were able to vote. As a result of Reconstruction and the leadership of these ex-slaves, many poor whites who never had access to public schools suddenly got to go to school.</p>\n\n<p>That was a moment when the frame of racism could have been broken and it didn't happen. It didn't happen precisely because many of those same poor whites, who were enjoying the fruits of democracy for the first time, ended up choosing their skin color over their class - and that was one of the biggest tragedies in American history.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways there is a parallel between the period of Reconstruction and what we think of as the modern Civil Rights Movement. And in both of those periods there were whites who were inspired by the black freedom struggle, who saw the potential for a new society rooted in the destruction of racism - a society that would benefit themselves and benefit all of humanity.</p>\n\n<p>In the Civil Rights Movement there were many poor people who in fact were inspired by the demands of the Student Nonviolent Coordinated Committee, who were inspired by the demands for economic justice.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it is not an accident that the tail end of that Civil Rights Movement put economic justice at the forefront, much like during Reconstruction when economic justice became a critical issue. But once again, in both of those moments, many of the whites who could benefit from the struggle for economic justice decided that it didn't make sense to make an alliance with black people and again they chose race over class. Which was again, a big tragedy for America.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Isn't racism just a form of ignorance and fear?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I teach about racism the first thing I say to my students is that racism is not ignorance. Racism is knowledge. Racism in some ways is a very complicated system of knowledge, where science, religion, philosophy, are used to justify inequality and hierarchy. That is foundational. Racism is not simply a kind of visceral feeling you have when you see someone who is different from you.</p>\n\n<p>Because in fact if you look at the history of the world there are many people who look different who are seen as both attractive and unattractive. It is not about how you look, it is about how people assign meaning to how you look. And that is learned behavior, you see.</p>\n\n<p>And that is why you can't think of racism as simply 'not knowing.' That is not the case at all - on the contrary.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"e2b3298a-a33d-4bc3-94b3-0c9a63f7a7c2","name":"Making Whiteness: Whiteness and Class","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"e641aeb5-a5a3-442d-83f0-5df5bf02c5a4","name":"Making Whiteness"}]}},{"id":"9f581c9d-e57e-46bd-b44d-427baf483f2e","name":"Founding Race: Race and Democracy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"d52b46a5-a433-43eb-971b-c13d54da18e4","name":"Founding America"}]}},{"id":"6ee07638-a043-4161-a465-edaac06d9445","name":"Racial Classification: Identity","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Hierarchy","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":null,"backref_field_tag_node_faq":null,"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"White Supremacy","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"The Hispanic Color Divide","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>John R.

This question assumes that we all have an identity that we use all the time. Therefore, we can go through the process of selecting people who also have similar identities that they use all the time, and these identities can be put into one community of like identities. But the question I would ask is, (1) is there an identity that any person uses all the time, and (2) is that identity race?</p>\n\n<p>First, I think it's absolutely true that people who have similar identities, similar interests, gravitate to one another. For example, I'm a tennis player. When I go on vacation or some place where I know very few people and I see another person who is playing tennis, I gravitate towards that person because it's the thing we have in common. When I lived in Germany, one of the things I did, because my German is terrible, is I tended to gravitate towards people who could speak English. Why? Because we could talk. Some of them were native English speakers; some of them were Germans who spoke English very well. The point is that it was the English, the linguistic part of my identity that we had in common and identified with.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption in this question, which is a bad assumption, is that race is the most important part of a person's identity and that's it's the most important part all of the time. I would argue that that's not true at all. In fact, I would argue that in some cases, race is so far down the line of important parts of your identity that depending on the particular circumstance, it becomes superfluous. One might ask, during the Second World War, when the English faced the Germans, did they say, \"Hey, we're all the same race so we shouldn't have these kinds of problems\"? What about wars in various parts of Africa where people do horrible things to their enemies.

Past practice has proven that that's just not the case. At the outset of affirmative action programs, women were incredibly underrepresented in fields such as law and medicine and that gap was quickly eliminated within just a couple of years. Since then, in most programs, women (as an aggregate category) no longer benefit from affirmative action. The same thing happened with various subcategories of Asians at schools in the 1970s. For example, Japanese Americans were removed from affirmative action consideration at the UC Berkeley law school. Historically, admissions committees have used representational numbers as a guideline for which groups continue to need affirmative action and which ones do not.</p>\n\n<p>But note that legislation such as the new Ward Connerly initiative (the racial privacy initiative that's actually being renamed the \"Information Ban Initiative\") seeks to ban the collection of race-based data as an outdated invasion of privacy. Should such an ill-advised measure succeed, it would be impossible to measure progress (or setbacks). If we are supposed to be an egalitarian society, don't we want to know where the racial disparities are? Don't we care that Dorothy Roberts, in her recent book Shattered Bonds, discovered that 95% of all the children in the foster care system in Chicago are black? Or that 42% of the children in the foster care system nationwide are black even though they constitute only 17% of the nation's children? If we do care, then we need to keep records as a measure for devising social policies to address these troubling disparities.</p>"},"changed":1531439124},{"title":"Why do we have to pay for wrongs of the past?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>This is a familiar question: \"Why am I responsible for the sins of the past?\" In terms of slavery, we need to recognize slavery as an important institution upon which America's wealth was built.
