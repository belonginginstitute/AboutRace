This seems statistically significant, if nothing else. However, I also understand that this was not always true, particularly in the ancient world.

What the writer is really saying is, why have I only learned about advances in science, literature, and art in white nations. Well, basically it's because western education is biased towards western historical achievement. How about art and literature in China, how about literature in the subcontinent of India, Native American poetry and philosophy? There are terribly impressive things! So what we reveal when we ask questions like this is not the reality of history, but the bias of the education we receive.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>What I would add is that we shouldn't necessarily fall into what I would consider to be an essentialist view that because the Egyptians wouldn't be considered white today, they would be considered black today. The concepts of black and white, as we have them today, just simply didn't exist in the ancient world. These racial categories we're posing are fairly recent creations. In fact, the idea that there was a white race and a black race as such can be dated to the late 17th, early 18th century. So we don't know whether all these people who today would be considered black were actually considered black at the time, because we may be reading back our ideas of race as we've constructed them in the last two or three hundred years and to earlier times they really wouldn't apply.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>That brings up another part of the question that I was really amused by, actually, when I read it. What's a white nation? Is the United States a white nation? And if so, how do we judge the accomplishments of Charles Drew, for example, an African American who discovered blood plasma? Upon which our medical technology today is based. Again, there are many assumptions in the questions which need to be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing to remember is that the nations of Europe and the western world developed based on their exploitation of the human and natural resources of what we now call third world nations. If they had not had access to those human and natural resources, they would be far less developed. And incidentally, some of the assumptions implicit in the question are based on military power and not literary, artistic, or scientific skill.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1be0b7bc-8cf1-4005-b36b-28429939de66"}}
