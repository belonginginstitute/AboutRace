You mentioned some: lack of investment in education, poor parenting, excessive substance abuse, domestic abuse, criminality, inability to save money. This might be a persuasive argument if, for example, the rates of substance abuse or domestic violence were statistically higher among the poor or among minorities. But they're not. They plague all communities - white and non-white, rich and poor - but have very different impacts on those communities because some people are largely immune to serious police action, because sentencing practices vary considerably by race, and because affluent people generally have many ways to hide these kinds of behaviors from public view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, one of the subgroups in the United States with the highest rate of spousal abuse is police officers. There's also a noticeable spike in reports of domestic violence this year in families of U.S. military personnel. Yet we don't see that fact alone plunging their families into poverty, nor do we see many exposés on the cultural values of the police and military communities on the evening news. Policing and sentencing practices are really crucial factors here, as well.

Something like three quarters of the half million people jailed for drug possession are black or Latino, despite the fact that rates of drug use are about the same in all ethnic or racial groups. Whites use drugs just as much as others do. I came from a relatively affluent white community where lots of kids were doing drugs, but they weren't going to jail for many years for it.

There is a lot of attention paid to these issues in terms of cultural difference. Yet as The Economist recently reported, western Europeans register higher rates of out-of-wedlock parenthood than do African Americans. Yet this phenomenon gets special attention only in the latter case. Furthermore, there's no evidence that people raised in what are commonly referred to as \"nuclear families\" actually fare better in absolute terms than those who grew up in more extended families.

Consider some of the most often cited causes for black or Hispanic poverty. You mentioned some: lack of investment in education, poor parenting, excessive substance abuse, domestic abuse, criminality, inability to save money. This might be a persuasive argument if, for example, the rates of substance abuse or domestic violence were statistically higher among the poor or among minorities. But they're not. They plague all communities - white and non-white, rich and poor - but have very different impacts on those communities because some people are largely immune to serious police action, because sentencing practices vary considerably by race, and because affluent people generally have many ways to hide these kinds of behaviors from public view.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one of the subgroups in the United States with the highest rate of spousal abuse is police officers. There's also a noticeable spike in reports of domestic violence this year in families of U.S. military personnel. Yet we don't see that fact alone plunging their families into poverty, nor do we see many exposés on the cultural values of the police and military communities on the evening news. Policing and sentencing practices are really crucial factors here, as well.
