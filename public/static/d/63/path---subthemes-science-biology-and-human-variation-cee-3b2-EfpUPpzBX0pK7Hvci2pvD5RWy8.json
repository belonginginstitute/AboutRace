If looked at from a distance, the way we see the world, which seems mundane, is actually exotic.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>To some extent this is recognizable from the study of history. We can look back at the dress styles of the 1960s, which seemed entirely appropriate, normal, natural, at the time, and see them now as weird. Anthropology does this more broadly. It shows that the ideas we take for granted are not necessarily the way things have to be, maybe not even the way they actually are. It is an intellectual field that can be threatening - primarily because its very reason for being is to subvert existing social power structures and to question things we take for granted as natural about the way we are (Boas 1928).</p>\n\n<p>Now, one of the ideas we take for granted most strongly in our society is that races represent natural categories of people. That is to say, the human species comes packaged a small number of ways, even color-coded for your convenience: black, white, yellow, red. You belong to one of these categories. Your race is a property of your constitution, innate and assigned at birth. And by virtue of being in that category, you have more in common, particularly more of the fundamentally important things in common, with other people in the same category than with people in other categories.</p>\n\n<p>I want to begin by questioning that assumption. The earliest anthropologists in the mid-1800s recognized that there was an intimate connection between the way people think about the world and how they classify it. After all, this is how we make sense of the infinite jumble of things we are exposed to - we decide \"this\" is a kind of \"that,\" and slightly different from something else, which also a kind of \"that,\" but a different kind of \"that.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly evident in social relationships centering on the family. You, for example, give the same name to four different people: your mother's sister, your father's sister, your mother's brother's wife, and your father's brother's wife. Of course, I am describing your aunts.</p>\n\n<p>Why should you put all those people in the same category? Your mother's brother's wife and your father's brother's wife aren't even genetically related. Your mother's sister and father's sister are genetically related to you, but they're on opposite sides of the family. Traditionally, they don't even have your family name; only your father's brother's wife has your family name.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the fact is that other people do it differently. They may have one term for an aunt on the father's side of the family and a different word for an aunt on the mother's side of the family. They may have one term for blood relatives and another for spouses of blood relatives. You might notice also that you differentiate by sex the names of your father's brother and father's brother's wife,- they are your uncle and aunt - but their children, both male and female, are all termed cousins. Why not differentiate male from female cousins as we do uncles and aunts? And we don't even have a word for the person married to your cousin (Schneider 1968).</p>\n\n<p>So people impose order on their social universe by classifying it, by deciding that these people cluster together under this name, and that they're different from those other people assigned a different name. These classifications sometimes match genetic relationships and sometimes diverge from them significantly. How we classify is not based on nature, not determined by nature, but is a construction of our social minds that we impose on nature to help us organize things, in this case our relatives.</p>\n\n<p>How did we come up with these social conventions for classifying our relatives as we do? We don't really know.</p>\n\n<p>We do know a bit more about how we came to classify species as we do, and the same general things hold true. Jorge Luis Borges (1965) writes of a Chinese encyclopedia that \"divides animals into: (a) belonging to the Emperor; (b) embalmed; (c) tame; (d) suckling pigs; (e) sirens; (f) fabulous; (g) stray dogs; (h) included in the present classification; (i) frenzied; (j) innumerable; (k) drawn with a very fine camels hair brush; (l) et cetera; (m) having just broken the water pitcher; (n) that from a long way off look like flies.\" This is apocryphal, of course, but it makes the point well: You have to classify animals somehow. Why not this way?</p>\n\n<p>If you go to the Bible you find that the ancient Hebrews classified animals too: see for example Leviticus, chapter 11 and Deuteronomy, chapter 14. They did it to decide what was ritually clean or unclean, and on that basis, what was edible or inedible (Douglas, 1966). And their criteria, which are entirely natural, were where the animal lives and how it moves. And so they divided the animals into flying animals, swimming animals, and walking or crawling animals. These divisions certainly work, although there are some areas where they do not map well onto our modern categories. The bat is classified with the birds, for example; and lizards and mice end up together.</p>\n\n<p>Our own modern scientific classification of animals is based on evolutionary relationships, common ancestry - although in fact scientists started categorizing animals this way about a century before they realized that was what they were doing.</p>\n\n<p>We, for example, are mammals. That was established in the year 1758, a hundred years before Darwin, by a Swedish biologist named Linnaeus. Mammals constitute a natural category. If you ask biology students, they will tell you we're mammals. Why? Because we nurse our young.</p>\n\n<p>Here is something the student probably can not tell you. Do we nurse our young because we are mammals, or are we mammals because we nurse our young? Let me rephrase the question: Why is milk so important in the great scheme of things that we should take our very name on that basis? Couldn't we come up with the same group using a different criterion, and so why don't we?</p>\n\n<p>For example, Aristotle more than two thousand years ago called land animals \"Quadrupedia\" (four-legged), and divided them into those that lay eggs and those that give birth to live offspring. Creating a category of four-legged creatures that give birth to live offspring gives you basically the same constellation of animals as the category of mammals (with a few exceptions, like the duck-billed platypus).</p>\n\n<p>Mammals actually have many features that distinguish them from reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds - hair, for one thing. Some scientists in the 18th century actually did call this group \"Pilosa,\" or hairy things. But Linnaeus called us mammals, based on an anatomical feature that's only functional in half of our species, and then only rarely.</p>\n\n<p>So why did he do that?</p>\n\n<p>It turns out to have been a political gesture. In the 1750s, there was major controversy surrounding the practice of wet-nursing. Many middle- and upper-class women in Europe were sending their babies off to stay with poor women in the country to be fed, rather than nursing the infants themselves. Linnaeus was active in the movement opposing this practice. In fact he wrote a book on the virtues of breastfeeding your own children, how it was natural for mothers to do this, and how therefore wet-nursing was something unnatural and bad. Up to that time he had been calling mammals simply Quadrupedia, like Aristotle. Now he calls mammals Mammalia, and uses his \"objective\" scientific classification to make this point. He is saying the natural role of women is to nurse their own children - that is what is right, and that is what your family should do (Schiebinger, 1993).</p>\n\n<p>The point of all this is to show that what a biology student takes for granted as a fact of nature, that we are in our very essence a lactating species, is actually a fact of history - a political stand from the 18th century embedded into biology. It is true, of course, mammals are a natural unit and the group can be defined by nursing, but having a shared natural property doesn't make a group an objective category, simply \"out there\" to be discovered. It is not obviously the case that breastfeeding is the key feature that makes us mammals, any more than having a single bone in the lower jaw (which all Mammalia have, and only Mammalia have) is the key feature that would make us \"One-bone-in-jaw-malia.\" There's more here than nature.</p>\n\n<p>So: we make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if there isn't a natural classification for the things we're interested in, we often come up with one anyway. For example, time is continuous, but we divide it into sixty-minute hours, twelve-hour days and nights, and seven-day weeks, with the days named after skygods. These are arbitrary conventions; we inherited these time divisions from the ancient Babylonians (Zerubavel, 1985).</p>\n\n<p>Here's the paradox. The classifications that are the most arbitrary, and the least natural, seem to be the ones that matter the most to us. People could be categorized in many ways. There are short people and tall people; people with straight teeth and crooked teeth; with wiry, muscular, or chunky body builds; with freckles; with more or less body hair. These are natural differences, but they're not very important to us.</p>\n\n<p>What is important? Whether you're an American or an Iraqi. Whether you're a Nazi, a Communist, a Democrat, or a Republican. An Oriole fan or a Yankee fan. Rich or poor. Us or them. These categories of history and of society, the categories of human invention, are far more important to our daily lives than the categories of natural variation in our species.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, people look different, but the people who hate each other the most are generally the people who are biologically the most similar --Irish and English, Hutu and Tutsi, Arab and Israeli, Huron and Iroquois; Bosnian, Croatian, and Serb. Group identifications and animosities, lives and life-and-death struggles, are rooted in cultural, social, political, and economic differences, not in biological differences. Biological difference can be recruited to reinforce them, because that makes human evil appear to be the result of nature, but nature is not at the root here.</p>\n\n<p>So returning to the issue of race, how old is the idea that there are, say, four kinds of people, each localized to a continent? The answer is that the first person to suggest it was a Frenchman named François Bernier in 1684.</p>\n\n<p>The ancient Egyptians and Greeks had recognized that people from different places looked different, that the Egyptians were more darkly complected than the Greeks, and less darkly complected than the Nubians, and all of them were lighter than the Scythians. Of course in those days, long travel was done over land, where the physical differences between neighboring peoples were more subtle and gradual.</p>\n\n<p>But by the end of the seventeenth century, most of the world had been visited by Europeans. Their typical mode of travel was by boat - you boarded in one place where the people looked a certain way, and several weeks later you got off at a port where the people looked quite different, for example in West Africa and East Asia (Brace 1995).</p>\n\n<p>It was our friend Linnaeus, once again, who in 1758 scientifically formalized the distinction among the continental populations of the world. The order Primates (a term Linnaeus coined) subsumed several genera, of which our genus Homo was one. Homo (Linnaeus thought) subsumed two species, Homo sapiens (us) and Homo nocturnus (incorporating the more anthropomorphic descriptions of the chimpanzee). So how many subspecies did the species Homo sapiens subsume?</p>\n\n<p>Linnaeus decided there were five subspecies of our species. One was Homo sapiens monstrosus, which included people with birth defects, and the other four were geographic. Those were white Europeans, yellow Asians, red Americans, and black Africans.</p>\n\n<p>Linnaeus maintained that he was simply doing to humans what he did to any other species, being scientific and objective in his categorizations. But if you read the characteristics he used to differentiate the geographic subspecies, you see that they're ridiculous over-generalizations, frequently outright slanders, and usually not even biological attributes at all.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, for example, Homo sapiens americanus is red, ill-tempered, and impassive. After a terse description of looks and personality of each group, Linnaeus proceeds to describe their dress and government. Americans paint themselves, Europeans wear tight-fitting clothes, Asians wear loose-fitting clothes, and Africans anoint themselves with grease.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it's easy to bash scientists from 250 years ago. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that this is very specifically the origin of the idea that there is a scientific and authoritative way to categorize people into four distinct groups (Hudson, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The generation of scholars immediately after Linnaeus jettisoned the use of clothing as taxonomic criterion. But it's not until the middle of the present century that anthropologists began to question the empirical basis for generalizing continentally about the human species (Montagu, 1941). We now recognize that these are neither the discrete fundamental units of our species, nor are they even comparable biological subdivisions.</p>\n\n<p>The human species simply doesn't come packaged into something like zoological subspecies. Rather, what we find are local populations that are similar to other populations nearby and different from populations far away. This variation no more tells us there are four kinds of people than it tells us there are five or six or twelve or thirty-seven kinds of people (Montagu, 1963; Livingstone, 1962; Marks, 1995).</p>\n\n<p>If we focus on the people from the most geographically divergent places of the earth - say, Norway, Nigeria, and Vietnam - of course they look different. But what does that difference represent? There is no reason to think it represents primordial purity, as if once upon a time there were people living only in Oslo, Lagos, and Saigon. There have always been, as far as we know, people living in the rest of the Old World.</p>\n\n<p>Consider, for example, the people of South Asia - India and Pakistan. Many of them are darkly pigmented like Africans and have facial features similar to Europeans, yet they live on the continent of Asia. What do you do with these people? And if you put them in a separate group, then what about all the other people who look distinctive - Polynesians, New Guineans, Australians, North Africans?</p>\n\n<p>Our ideas about the small number of basic human groups have been shaped largely by accidents of European history - the ports of call for the merchant fleet - and by patterns of immigration into the United States. Immigrants to the United States have come disproportionately from the regions surrounding those ports of call.</p>\n\n<p>Africans are incredibly heterogeneous. When we think of Africans we often think of West Africans. But remember you have the tallest people in the world in parts of Kenya and the Sudan, and the shortest people in the world in parts of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The people of East Africa look different from the people of West Africa; the people of southern Africa look different too. There are populations of very variable facial features and skin tones.</p>\n\n<p>Why group them all together and distinguish them from Europeans and Asians? Answer: because it's a difference we want to emphasize for political reasons. Of course, when you do that, you create a classic empirical problem at the boundaries. Let's say you juxtapose a Negroid African race against a Euro-Mediterranean Caucasoid race, as anthropologists used to do. Here's the simple fallacy: it works for the Swedes and the Senegalese, but what about the Ethiopians and Iranians?</p>\n\n<p>Any way you compare them - physically, genetically - the African Ethiopians are more similar to the \"Caucasoid\" Iranians than they are to the people of Senegal. Why? Simple: they are closer geographically. Likewise, Iranians are more similar to Ethiopians than they are to Swedes. So how can you objectively put a boundary line between them and decide they're in different groups. Such a division is just not biologically true.</p>\n\n<p>Humans vary gradually in nature, yet for cultural reasons we partition them into races (just as we divide time, which is continuous, into discrete units of minutes, hours, and weeks).</p>\n\n<p>Race is intended to denote discrete basic subdivisions of the human species, equivalent to a subspecies of mice, within which there is little variability and among which there are discrete differences. These subdivisions do not exist objectively in the human species. Why? Two reasons: First, populations are adapted to the places they live. Since geography and climatic conditions vary gradually and continuously, so do the human populations occupying these spaces. And second, what Cole Porter called \"the urge to merge\" has its effect. That is, human populations interbreed with their neighbors: population A with population B, B with C, C with D. And of course, sometimes A with C or D - that is, with people from further away. All human populations have histories - they trade. None of them has been sitting isolated and untouched since the Pleistocene (and the failure to appreciate that, by the way, is one of the last great ethnocentrisms in modern science).</p>\n\n<p>This is why anthropologists no longer talk about races; we talk about populations. We talk about local, fluid, biocultural units. Those are what are out there in nature, as far as we can tell.</p>\n\n<p>Now, because what we have are fluid, biocultural, historical populations, not discrete subspecies, we run into a problem when we superimpose our preconceptions about heredity on genetic data. Let's imagine that Mom and Dad have a baby girl. For some reason Baby Girl either wants to, or has to, prove her racial identity. The ultimate arbiter of hereditary issues is science, the science of genetics. Mom and Dad look racially appropriate as does Baby Girl, but for some reason that's not enough. So Baby Girl is subjected to a genetic test to look for a specific genetic marker that her race has and that others don't.</p>\n\n<p>If we take her family back two more generations, we know she has four grandparents and eight great-grandparents. Did all eight have that genetic marker? Because if one of them didn't have it, there is a small but significant chance that Baby Girl inherited that racially \"wrong\" genetic marker. And that's precisely the problem. If one great-grandma was different - either she was from somewhere else, or she just inherited a different marker from one of her ancestors, or the genetic generalization was incorrect - then the \"wrong\" marker has a fifty-fifty chance of being passed on each generation.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, you could have a child who looks just like you and your spouse, but fails a genetic test to match her to your racial category on account of one great-grandparent (who may have been just as racially \"correct\" as the other seven). That's why you can't do a genetic test for race. Race and genetics don't map on to one another particularly well.</p>\n\n<p>This parallels, of course, the old miscegenation laws, which prohibited marriage between blacks and whites. If you're going to prohibit intermarriage, you have to define precisely who is black and who is white. The classic definition came to be known as the \"one drop of blood rule\" - any non-white ancestry made you non-white. In practice, one black great-grandparent defined you as legally black; seven white great-grandparents weren't enough to make you white (Wright, 1996; Pascoe, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The technology is different today, but the cultural mind-set is the same. The problem is simple and anthropological. Race is inherited, but in a different fashion from biological heredity. Race is inherited according to no scientific laws, but rather by a commonsense or folk cultural system.</p>\n\n<p>Like the way we name our relatives, racial divisions are not determined by biology, and they don't map very well onto genetic relationships. In fact, races are simply named groups, nothing more. Naming is what confers meaning, and this is wonderfully illustrated by a photomontage from Newsweek a couple of years ago. They asked \"What Color Is Black?\" and showed that the category \"black people\" subsumes people who look very different. And that's precisely the point. A genetic test for \"black\" would be failed by half the people on that page of photographs (and not necessarily the lightest complected half either), and would even be failed by half the inhabitants of Africa. On the other hand, many non-Africans would \"pass\" the test.</p>\n\n<p>The key thing is to appreciate that race and genetics aren't from the same worlds. So it's not that one is good and the other is bad. It's that one is scientific, and the other provides a means of localizing yourself and others in a very subjective world of social relations. The difficulty comes when we confuse them for one another. It's not that race doesn't exist, an idea I occasionally see espoused in the newspaper; it's that race doesn't exist as a \"biological entity.\" It certainly exists as a symbolic, social category. That actually makes it culturally more real and more important than if it were biological.</p>\n\n<p>Race is not a category derived from genetics. But our folk views are very deep rooted. For example, I can see the sun rise, traverse a path across the heavens, and set over the opposite horizon; yet we now know, of course, that the sun doesn't go around the earth. It's an optical illusion. To a large extent the growth of science involves overturning those commonsense ideas and showing them to be better explained in other ways that aren't immediately apparent.</p>\n\n<p>There are four major categories of folk ideologies of heredity. The first is the one we've already discussed - the existence of human subspecies or \"taxonomism.\" The second is \"racism,\" the belief that a person is simply the embodiment of the group, and thereby possesses whatever attributes are assigned to the group. It's a folk theory of heredity because it confers innate properties upon people based just on membership, rather than through observation of what the person is really like.</p>\n\n<p>There is another component to this fallacy, and that is the relationship between what people don't do and what they can't do. The Bell Curve (Herrnstein and Murray 1994) argued from test scores to what the authors called \"cognitive ability\". In fact, however, we can't study abilities, we can only study performances; and the relationship between them contains an important asymmetry - ability is only one component of the performance you observe. Good performance implies abilities; but poor performance does not imply the lack of abilities. The very concept of ability - something endowed at birth, yet perceptible only after it's been developed - is not scientific, not genetic, not empirical, and exists as simply folk wisdom (Marks 1997).</p>\n\n<p>Third is \"hereditarianism,\" the idea that you are whatever is in your cells, that \"blood will tell\" because \"like begets like\". This idea goes back a long way in human history. The royal family is treated better than the average Londoner for that very reason. This mode of thought, obviously, has provided a justification for hereditary aristocracies for millennia.</p>\n\n<p>We see it in high-tech forms now, in the idea that genes, rather than blood, will tell. The problem here is that we know very little about the development of normal traits in people. Much of what we know comes from the study of pathology, and it's very tricky to infer normal function from the study of its breakdown. Imagine trying to figure out what the fuel injector in your car actually does by opening the hood, smashing it with a hammer, and observing the results. Since previously there was little coming out of your exhaust but now you see billows of black smoke, you might come to believe that you have isolated the \"smoke controller\". Well, of course, that's not what the fuel injector actually does - smoke emission is just a side effect of screwing it up.</p>\n\n<p>Let me give you a more concrete example. There is a rare disease called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. It results from mutation of a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for the production of an enzyme called hypozanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). The mutated gene cannot produce HGPRT, and without this enzyme you have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Boys afflicted with this syndrome have an irresistible compulsion to flail and to bite. They end up biting their lips and fingers and require strong restraint.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the failure of this gene has a behavioral effect - a terrible, horrible effect. But what does this tell us about normal people who self-mutilate? What does it tell us about nail-biters like me? Or rituals of scarification? Or punks with pierced body parts? Or teenage girls with low self-image, who cut themselves? Absolutely nothing. The vast majority of self-mutilating behavior in our species occurs in people who don't have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, people who are genetically normal. The gene for a bizarre pathological behavior tells us virtually nothing about the general occurrence of the behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, a geneticist can be quoted making precisely that connection in Scientific American (Beardsley 1995). It is actually a non-sequitur; an inference from folk heredity. And now we learn that social graces are controlled by a gene on the X-chromosome, based on a study of girls with Turner's syndrome (Angier 1997).</p>\n\n<p>The last major component of modern folk heredity is \"essentialism,\" the idea that we have to ignore apparent differences to find an invisible underlying uniformity. That is the basis for thinking there might be a genetic test for race, as we discussed earlier.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent study (Skorecki et al. 1997), it was determined that 54 percent of self-designated Hebrew priests, many of whom have the surname Cohen, had the same configuration of two genes on the Y-chromosome; as opposed to only 33% of Jews who did not think they were priests. On this basis the authors inferred that this one was the real genetic constitution of the Jewish priestly line inherited directly from biblical Aaron.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, often people with the same last names are going to be more closely related than people with different last names, reflecting recent common ancestry (known as isonymy). If you survey their Y chromosomes, you're going to find more homogeneity than you'd find in a random sample. Without a control group, to look at the Y chromosome in a sample of Horowitzes or Steinbergs for example, the inference that the one represented at 54 percent rather than 33 percent in Cohens is somehow distinguishing and authentic is dubious at best. But the result was reported in the New York Times nevertheless (Grady, 1997a, 1997b).</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, the authors of that report find themselves in the middle of an identity controversy; after all, people want to know authoritatively if they are \"really\" Hebrew priests or not. Of course, nobody's a Hebrew priest; there hasn't been a priesthood for centuries. Even so, these genetic data are invested with cultural authority, in spite of how shaky the inference is. The construction of identity is a political arena in which geneticists are uniquely unqualified to work. The failure to appreciate the responsibilities thus incurred contributed to the demise of the Human Genome Diversity Project (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1991; Mead, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>Let me conclude, then, with a diagnosis and a prescription. Genetics is a very important area of scientific research; we need it, and we need public understanding of it. But what is even more pressing is the need to understand the difference between scientific heredity (or genetics) and folk ideas on heredity. Geneticists should contribute to educating the public about these distinctions. There are three reasons why they haven't lived up to that responsibility. One, as cultural beings, geneticists have assimilated the same folk ideas as everyone else, and it is very hard to step out of their mind-set. Two, this is largely humanistic knowledge, outside the formal training of an average geneticist.</p>\n\n<p>The third reason is a bit more insidious. When geneticists tell you that genetics is the solution to social problems, personality problems, global problems, they may have a conflict of interest. In other words, sometimes geneticists are willing to exploit cultural ideas to justify scientific ones.</p>\n\n<p>To get the Human Genome Project off the ground, its first director, James Watson, told Time (Jaroff 1989), \"We used to think our fate was in the stars. Now we know, in large measure, our fate is in our genes.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now that, as Clarence Darrow used to say, would be interesting if true. But it raises a lot of questions. Do we have fates, in any significant sense of that term? Do we know they have been localized to our cellular nuclei? Is genetics really just hi-tech astrology, although presumably more accurate?</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that such a statement might be a true inference about nature, but obviously it's more than that. It's also a political statement about the immutability of one's place in the fabric of society. If we have fates and they are in our genes, then by implication the differences between a Harvard professor and an urban teenage gang member are explained by recourse to bands and blots and gels, and there would be little hope to change their life trajectories. Also, the statement encodes a political philosophy towards the social problems out there requiring solutions.</p>\n\n<p>To appreciate Watson's statement fully, you have to realize that it was also a grant proposal. It was made in the context of trying to raise 10 billion dollars of federal money to study genetics. Of course geneticists are going to tell you that what they study is the most important thing in your life. To the extent that folk ideologies about heredity reinforce the importance of genetics in the public eye, there's not much incentive to distinguish between them. It was true in the 1920s and it's true now.</p>\n\n<p>We face two questions. First, how do we get geneticists to distinguish between scientific and non-scientific ideas about heredity? (Because if they don't, the rest of us certainly can't be expected to.) And, second, how can we believe what geneticists say when they have an economic stake in the outcome of the research? It is the responsibility of the genetics community to confront these two problems, and it may require rethinking how geneticists are trained.</p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>Angier, N.

How does race affect people today?</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>There's less - and more - to race than meets the eye:</p>\n\n<p>1. Race is a modern idea. Ancient societies, like the Greeks, did not divide people according to physical distinctions, but according to religion, status, class, even language. The English language didn't even have the word 'race' until it turns up in 1508 in a poem by William Dunbar referring to a line of kings.</p>\n\n<p>2. Race has no genetic basis. Not one characteristic, trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so-called race from all the members of another so-called race.</p>\n\n<p>3. Human subspecies don't exist. Unlike many animals, modern humans simply haven't been around long enough or isolated enough to evolve into separate subspecies or races. Despite surface appearances, we are one of the most similar of all species.</p>\n\n<p>4. Skin color really is only skin deep. Most traits are inherited independently from one another. The genes influencing skin color have nothing to do with the genes influencing hair form, eye shape, blood type, musical talent, athletic ability or forms of intelligence. Knowing someone's skin color doesn't necessarily tell you anything else about him or her.</p>\n\n<p>5. Most variation is within, not between, \"races.\" Of the small amount of total human variation, 85% exists within any local population, be they Italians, Kurds, Koreans or Cherokees. About 94% can be found within any continent. That means two random Koreans may be as genetically different as a Korean and an Italian.</p>\n\n<p>6. Slavery predates race. Throughout much of human history, societies have enslaved others, often as a result of conquest or war, even debt, but not because of physical characteristics or a belief in natural inferiority. Due to a unique set of historical circumstances, ours was the first slave system where all the slaves shared similar physical characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>7. Race and freedom evolved together. The U.S. was founded on the radical new principle that \"All men are created equal.\" But our early economy was based largely on slavery. How could this anomaly be rationalized? The new idea of race helped explain why some people could be denied the rights and freedoms that others took for granted.</p>\n\n<p>8. Race justified social inequalities as natural. As the race idea evolved, white superiority became \"common sense\" in America. It justified not only slavery but also the extermination of Native peoples, exclusion of Asian immigrants, and the taking of Mexican lands by a nation that professed a belief in democracy. Racial practices were institutionalized within American government, laws, and society.</p>\n\n<p>9. Race isn't biological, but racism is still real. Race is a powerful social idea that gives people different access to opportunities and resources. Our government and social institutions have created advantages that disproportionately channel wealth, power, and resources to white people. This affects everyone, whether we are aware of it or not.</p>\n\n<p>10. Colorblindness will not end racism. Pretending race doesn't exist is not the same as creating equality. Race is more than stereotypes and individual prejudice. To combat racism, we need to identify and remedy social policies and institutional practices that advantage some groups at the expense of others.</p>\n\n<p><em>RACE - The Power of an Illusion was produced by California Newsreel in association with the Independent Television Service (ITVS).

We can't find any genetic markers that are in everybody of a particular race, and in nobody of some other race.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I would never say that race doesn't exist. One of the things we're hearing now is that the human genome project is somehow showing us that race doesn't exist. Well, what it's showing us is that the simple biological notion of race is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>But just because race isn't something biological, that doesn't mean it's not real. There are a lot of things in our society that are real and are not biological. I think we would say marriage is something that's real. It's real because we have laws that we follow. We have social traditions that we follow. And those things are real. And race is real in that same sense. It's real in the sense that we create it in our relations between people. We treat people a certain way based on what race we believe them to be. Race, as we understand it as a social construct, has a lot to do with where somebody will live, what schools they will go to, what jobs they will get, whether or not they will have health insurance.</p>\n\n<p>So race does play a very important role in our lives, and I think race is real as a social construct. It's not real as a biologically definable thing. But it's no less important because it's a social construct. It's still, in this country at least, it's a very significant social stratifying practice…And similarly, there is a way in which, regardless of genetics, we live in a social world in which we ascribe races to people, and we have race as part of our personal identity, and that's still very important for the world in which we live.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes us different one from another?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If we take the standard racial categories, and we ask: Are the people whom we call black more like each other than they are like people who we call white, genetically speaking, the answer is no. There is as much or more diversity and genetic difference within any \"racial\" group as there is between people of different racial groups. We also know that any two people will have a genetic difference between them approximately one time in every thousand DNA bases. So if you were just going along through the genome, base by base by base, in my genome and a friend of mine's genome, approximately once every 1,000 bases there would be a difference between us. If then we looked at my genome compared to some colleague of mine, a different friend, there would also be a difference between us once every thousand places, but it might be a different place. So people, we say, are about 99.9% genetically similar to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Now, of course, when we study genetics, we're as interested in the differences as we are in the similarities. Of course, the .1 percent is - those are the genetic differences that make us unique from each other, genetically speaking. Those certainly aren't the differences that make us different as people, in the sense of, there is so much more than your genetics that makes you who you are. And right now in our society, there is a tremendous focus on genetics, and tremendous interest in genetics, but at the same time, we're sort of forgetting that there is biological development. There's psychological development. There are all of these other things that go into making a personality, even making the person's physiology. So what makes us different is both those genetic differences that we have between us, and also the interaction of that genome with the environment.</p>\n\n<p>And the environment is a very, very complicated thing. So I sort of mean the environment writ large, everything from the environment in the womb to the environment in your school, toxins that you may be exposed to at various points in your life, in your development, and so forth and so on. There are many, many things that go into making us different from each other. One of those things happens to be the genetic differences between us.</p>\n\n<p>There's another point that I think needs to be made: We tend to collapse or elide genetics and biology. But those are not the same thing. Genetics is a subset of biology, but biology is something much bigger. The relationship between genetics and biology is a complicated relationship. What you are biologically is only in part determined or influenced by your genetics. It's influenced by all kinds of other things as well, including what you eat, what your stress levels are, all kinds of other things. People forget that. We tend to talk about our genetic and biological make-up as though they're the same thing, and they're not. There's a lot more to biology than our genes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The contingency of race</strong></p>\n\n<p>Race is also, to use the jargon, geographically and historically contingent. What do we mean by that? Well, I have a friend who's from the Bahamas; he grew up there. And he was white in the Bahamas. So he lived his life socially positioned as a white person. He came to the United States and instantly he became a black person. Because our understanding here of what it means to be white and black is different than the understanding of people in the Bahamas. So what we see and label as black is different than what other people see and label as black.</p>\n\n<p>How a society constructs or understands race varies across societies, and even across parts of one society. There are a lot of things that go into ascribing race to a person. It's not just looks. It's not just physiognomy. It's also how they speak. Do they speak with an accent or not? Do they speak a certain style of English, or a different style of English, for instance? What religion are they, may have something to do with how we ascribe race to them.</p>\n\n<p>So when we say race is geographically contingent, it means you can move from one part of the country, or one part of the world to another, and you can actually change race.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, we know that there is a certain percentage of people who are born one race, and die another race. And this is partly because there are different rules for how people's race is ascribed on their birth certificate from their death certificate. For a while, if any parent was black, then the child was labeled black. Sometimes it was just what the delivering physician thinks. Now I think in many states the rule is, the race of the mother as she reports it is the race that the child will be labeled on their birth certificate. On the other hand, very often when people die, the race that goes on their death certificates is whatever the coroner or officials ascribe to that person. Since obviously you're dead, you don't get to say what race you are when you die. And so there are a few percent of people who are born one race and die another race.</p>\n\n<p>And historically, in order to be a naturalized citizen in this country, as an immigrant, you had to be categorized as white or black. And almost everybody who tried to naturalize - all but, I think, one case that went to the Supreme Court - all of them were people trying to be categorized as white. So the courts had to make decisions about who was white and who was not. Is an Armenian person white? There were a number of cases dealing with Asian people, and are they white or not white. And so one of the things that would happen is the person would come into court and say, \"Look, my skin color is as white as anybody else's skin color in here who is categorized as white.\"</p>\n\n<p>And it's very interesting to read these decisions and opinions, and have the court say, \"Race is not only about the color of your skin. It's about other things too, like your attitudes about family, your attitudes about politics.\" The court often decided who was white and who wasn't based on whether they felt that the person would politically fit well into the kind of society we were trying to build. And sometimes it was pretty explicit that this was what the court was doing. And I don't think the court is different from other people in our society, even today, that we understand race in a very complex way that takes into account all of these other aspects of a person besides simply their skin color, or whether their nose is flat or narrow, or the shape of their eyes and how almond shaped they are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should race be used as a category in biological research?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think as scientists we are still pretty confused about race, and what relevance race has to the things that we study, and whether or not race is a biological category. In part that's because scientists are human beings who have been socialized in this same society.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's too simplistic to say that we should throw out the concept of race when we're doing science, because although race is not genetically definable, race is still, because of its social power, it still influences us in ways that may influence our health. So whether you live near a toxic waste dump of some sort, that's correlated with what race you are. Whether or not you have health insurance is also correlated with what race you are. And so there are many things in this society that are correlated with race that may influence our health. So I think it's too simplistic to say that we should just never use race as an analytical variable when we're doing science, because there are important things that we could learn, and that we should learn.</p>\n\n<p>But the problem is that we shouldn't always assume that if we see racial disparities or differences, that those are due to genetic causes, as opposed to some other kind of cause.</p>\n\n<p>I personally think that, usually, if we want to understand something about inheritance, we probably ought to be using categories that are much narrower and more clearly defined than race. We know, for instance, that on the continent of Africa, there is a lot of genetic diversity there. And so trying to understand something about ancestry, back to particular parts of Africa, might be very interesting. But if it is, then categorizing by \"black\" is not going to be a very helpful categorization.</p>\n\n<p>And likewise, what does the category white mean? If you want to understand something about somebody's ancestry, and whether their ancestry goes back to northern Europe, or whether they have Celtic ancestry, and their ancestry goes back to the British isles, that might be much more important than the category \"white.\" This is almost a non-category, as is the category black. The people who are captured within those categories are so genetically and biologically diverse, and their ancestries might be very, very different. There could be people in this country who are black, who might now be categorized as African American, whose ancestry actually is Australian indigenous. Very, very different ancestry. Yet, if we look at them, we might categorize them as black, the same way we might categorize somebody whose family is recently from Africa as black.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of times when we're doing the science, we're not extremely careful about the descriptions of the populations that we're using, and so we will use 1,000 white people, people whose samples are gathered from various different points in the United States, for instance. But the ancestry of those people may be quite diverse. And then we will compare that to 100 or 50 samples of perhaps people from one town or small village from Africa. And then we will use the African sample to stand for \"black people\" and the sample of 1,000 white people from across the United States to stand for \"white people.\" And you're comparing two quite different things when you make such a comparison, because you're comparing one group of people who may be fairly closely related to each other biologically, to another group of people whose ancestry goes all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>And so it's not clear to me, necessarily, what the validity of those comparisons is. But however we can legitimately use those data, I think it's really important that we're very clear about who those data derive from. That one town in Africa should not necessarily represent all of Africa, or all black people, any more than northern Wisconsin should represent all white people. And we have a lot of confusion about that, and it's problematic for a lot of reasons. But one reason is because of how race and racism work. And one of the things that happens is that the less socially powerful group is perceived as being more homogeneous in general, as being less complex, less in need of individual attention, in some ways. And I think we play into that with the science when we use just a very small sample of African people, or African Americans, to stand for a whole \"race\" of people.</p>\n\n<p>It's critical that we use terminology carefully and thoughtfully. If we don't, we confuse ourselves. We often use terminology, I think, in a somewhat sloppy way, and we actually use racial categorizations for people when we really are looking at something that is not race, but something much more geographically defined, much smaller, and more concise, if you will, than race…</p>\n\n<p>And part of the problem with using race terminology when we really don't mean that is that we can reify the notion of race. And by reify I mean, take something that's an abstract notion and make it seem physically real. And that, I think, is very dangerous in the sense that, at the same time that the science is suggesting that these common-sense notions of separate, deep human racial categories are not really accurate or true, if we use racial terminology loosely and inappropriately we can reinforce people's notions that these racial categories are genetically real.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do we make of newspaper stories about genetic differences between races?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We often see reported stories about genetic differences between groups of people. Now, what does that really mean? Usually it doesn't mean that in a certain group there's a version of a gene that's just absent completely from another group. That does occasionally happen, but it's very rare. Usually what it means is that, say there's one gene that has two different versions, or two \"alleles.\" And in one group there might be 40% of allele A, and 60% of allele B. In another group, it might be 60% A, and 40% B. Those are statistically significant differences, but it doesn't mean that you could look at somebody from the first group and say, \"I know that they have allele B,\" and somebody from the second group, you could look at them and say, \"I know they have allele A.\" You can't do that based on these statistically significant group differences.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing we need to think about is, the statistics change depending on the denominator. So how you draw the circle around the population, or each of those populations, could change the number that you get. So 40% A, 60% B, if you defined the population differently, you might get 45% A and 55% B. So those numbers, they're things that you can find. They're real data. They're statistically significant. But we have to be careful of attributing perhaps too much real world, concrete meaning to those numbers, or thinking that those numbers are going to be true for all times and all places and all people. Those numbers are true based on this statistical sampling in the population as you have defined and described it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pharmacogenomics: Why are drug companies doing population genetics research?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We're all interested in understanding why a drug is effective in some people and not others. Why do people respond differently to different doses? Some people might need a large dose of a drug. Some people might need only a small dose for it to be effective. Another thing that pharmaceutical companies, and others, are very interested in, is why do just some small proportion of people have a really bad side effect in response to a certain drug?</p>\n\n<p>It has turned out though, that people who are studying what we call pharmacogenomics - i.e., the way genetic factors influence our responses to drugs - people who are studying pharmacogenomics are very interested in racial group differences in responses to drugs. And it's not really clear to me why they are.</p>\n\n<p>Supposing you find that among those people that in this country we define as African American, that you have 40% A and 60% B, and B is an allele that helps you respond well to a certain drug, whereas maybe among white people in this country, however so defined, you have 60% A and only 40% B. Why would this matter to a pharmaceutical company?</p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason it might matter is that they have to run all kinds of drug trials, all kinds of studies or research and experiments before they can get a drug to market. And if you can define a group of people who are more likely to be good responders to your drug, it may be that you can run fewer trials - that you need fewer people to get statistically significant results. You might be able to run faster drug trials. So there are reasons why pharmaceutical companies would like to know, as early as possible, who is likely to be a good responder to a drug. And those are legitimate reasons.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, is this going to mean that once the drug is approved, it gets approved only for a specific population, one racial group of people? That's a lot more problematic, particularly if you've got the kind of difference that we often see, where there's a statistically significant difference in allele frequency, perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>So say you find one of those differences. If a drug was only approved for use in one population of people, not everybody in that population is going to be a good responder to that drug. And not everybody in the other population would not respond to the drug. And so it's not clear to me that it would be really appropriate to say, \"This is a drug for white people,\" or \"This is a drug for black people,\" at least not based on genetics.</p>\n\n<p>And in fact, we know there are a lot of nongenetic factors that can play into how people respond to drugs. Things in your diet can cause an enzyme in your body, which may metabolize the drug. Your diet can up-regulate an enzyme, cause your body to make more of it. Your diet can also inhibit an enzyme, cause it not to work as effectively. Those are things that can influence responses to drugs at the biological level, in measurable ways that may or may not map onto culture, more so than race. And those are biological responses. But they're not genetic responses.</p>\n\n<p>So the differences we see in the way people respond to a drug - whether or not they have a side effect, how much of the drug is required before the drug is effective - these could be differences that have nothing to do with genetics, but may still relate to things like race or culture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic determinism - Correlation vs. causality</strong></p>\n\n<p>Looking for genes associated with any kind of trait is a really sort of sexy thing right now in science, and in the popular imagination of science. So there are all kinds of genes that people are trying to look for, genes that have to do with behaviors as well as genes that have to do with diseases, or genes that have to do with personality traits.</p>\n\n<p>One of the problems with this kind of work is that it's easy to infer certain kinds of causality. If you find a relationship, a correlation, between a certain version of a gene and a behavior or a personality trait, it's very interesting to infer some strong genetic causality, which may be very inaccurate. And so some person could say, \"Look, there must be a gene for incarceration.\" Well, you might find some gene associated with skin color that is also associated with likelihood of being incarcerated because we happen to be incarcerating a very high percentage of people of color in this country right now. So you might find some melanin gene associated with incarceration.</p>\n\n<p>Now, does this mean that somehow this bit of DNA makes you march right over to jails and pop yourself in? No. It means that a certain degree of melanin in your skin, in this society, puts you in a certain place socially where you are more likely to be arrested, more likely to be convicted, more likely to have a long sentence. It's mediated through the social relations, not that there is an inevitable connection between this gene and incarceration.</p>\n\n<p>And one of the fears is that if we think of genetics as being determinative in some sort of very fundamental way, where we have this sense of inevitability, that if something is genetic, then it's sort of unchangeable, that let's society off the hook. And even for basic biological traits, that's not necessarily the case at all. But certainly for these very socially mediated things, and psychological things, and personality traits, it's not, or very, very rarely, going to be the case that there is this kind of strong genetic causality between one or a few genes and some kind of social outcome, if you will.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One-drop rule and our common African ancestry</strong></p>\n\n<p>In some ways, we all have African ancestry. This is something that anthropologists have believed for a long time, and the genetics that we're doing is bearing that out. Modern humans came out of Africa, migrated out of the human population in Africa. Some people stayed in Africa. But basically, we all have African ancestry somewhere in our past.</p>\n\n<p>Now, at certain points in this country, we've actually had laws trying to define who was Negro or black. And in essence, that is trying to define who is close to African ancestry. And so we had this \"one-drop rule,\" this law that said basically if you had one drop of black \"blood,\" you were black. And although those laws are gone, they still influence the way we think about races today. So in the United States, we talk about very light-skinned black people. And in a sense, that's the same thing as saying, \"This is a person who has one drop.\" This person has maybe some African ancestry, and as long as we can see any African ancestry, as long as something is visible to us that looks like African ancestry, we tend to categorize that person as black.</p>\n\n<p>And in truth, we all have African ancestry. The only question is how recent that ancestry has been. I mean, there is some way in which we all have one drop of African blood in us, if not more than that.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, there have been times in this country, especially in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, when each state had its laws or its judicial decisions defining whether one was black or white. And that mattered a lot. It mattered because if you were black, then there were certain things, legally, that you could not do, certain places to which you did not have access, educational opportunities, etc. So it really mattered.</p>\n\n<p>But interestingly, the different states defined black and white differently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic screening</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the concerns about genetics and populations has to do with the targeting of at-risk populations. In other words, trying to understand when some group of people, however defined, has in that group a higher proportion of some allele that puts them at risk for a disease.</p>\n\n<p>That kind of targeting can be useful for a couple of reasons. One is that you get fewer false positives if you have more real positives in the group of people whom you are testing. So one reason we want to target at-risk populations is to get better testing accuracy, and that's true whether you're talking about genetics or anything else. If you're going to do some sort of screening where you're testing everybody in a population, you don't generally want to screen a population where almost nobody has what you're screening for.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is economic. We don't have the resources in this world to do every single medical test on every person; we don't have the resources to do neonatal testing for every possible malady somebody might have. It's not just that it's economically inefficient. At some point it becomes perhaps immoral to use resources in that way. They're scarce, in a sense, and they could be put to much better use some other way.</p>\n\n<p>So we don't just want to go around testing everybody for every conceivable thing that they might have or get. This means we have to make some choices, and trying to identify at-risk populations is one of those ways of making choices about when it's efficient enough that it's both economically feasible and perhaps morally acceptable to go around doing a kind of screening test on a group of people.</p>\n\n<p>Then the question is, how do you define an at-risk population? And we have used race and ethnicity as ways of doing that. So we've used race as a way of deciding who might be at risk for sickle cell disease; ethnicity to decide whether or not somebody is at risk of having Tay-sachs, or other conditions that are inherited through the Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. And so the question is, how do you define what the at-risk population is? How do you define that population for whom it seems acceptable to be doing screening tests? Are race and ethnicity the best ways of doing that?</p>\n\n<p>Because it's always a kind of proxy. What you're trying to do is just narrow down a group of people in which there will be more than the average number of at-risk people in this group. Sometimes, in the past, race and ethnicity have been the only way we've had to do that, in a sense. And we still haven't done it very well. Because we could be asking people more specific things about their ancestry, rather than just looking at them and thinking, are you black, or asking them, \"Are you Jewish?\" as a way of putting them into the at-risk or not category. We could have been asking people more specific things about their ancestry now.</p>\n\n<p>So it may be that in some cases we can ask people questions about their ancestry to narrow the at-risk population, to define it better, to define it more effectively than using race or ethnicity kinds of questions. Sometimes we might not be able to do that, because people might not, in general, know enough about the specifics of their ancestry for you to identify whether or not they are derived from people who are more likely to have sickle cell alleles, for example. But we do need to be careful. At least we need to be asking things to let us know if people have ancestors from India or a part of India or Greece where they might be at risk for sickle cell.</p>\n\n<p>And similarly with Tay-sachs disease, there are other populations besides those descended from Ashkenazi Jewish populations. There are other populations where people might be at risk for Tay-sachs. We know this. We know that people descended from Acadians, French Canadians, have higher risk for Tay-sachs disease. So if we're trying to define at-risk in some way, if we just ask about Ashkenazi Jewish descent, we're still not doing a good enough job.</p>\n\n<p>And it's always a tradeoff. If you can somehow define a population that is smaller than everybody who is born, and capture most of the people who are at risk in this more narrowly defined population, that has real advantages. But inevitably, some people will fall through the cracks. Just inevitably, there will be white people running around with sickle cell alleles.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"fde39cd1-eac8-469f-88f5-6d6287a1ba4e","name":"Science: Biology and human variation","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Genetics","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Why Humans haven't Evolved into Subspecies","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/1e294a9de8ff0733cf4c5e21bff265eb-cd24700e7e40476025f4c1c63f8f5bf1.jpg"}}}},{"title":"A Racialized Medical Genomics: Shiny, Bright and Wrong","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>End racist practices, end economic exploitation, and everybody's health improves.

I think we have to start off first by asking exactly what do we mean by athleticism. Because obviously a lot of diverse characteristics go into that - strength, flexibility, coordination, eyesight, endurance, just to name a few.

The more similar two species are, the more closely related they are by common descent. It's a bit more complicated with human populations because there's two ways that human populations can be similar to one another. Either they can have a common ancestry or they can be similar because they've had recent genetic unions reflected in what Cole Porter called the \"urge to merge.\" This is what geneticists call gene flow. Unfortunately, it's very hard to distinguish one pattern from the other. Are two populations similar by virtue of sharing common ancestry or genetic unions? The extraction of historical details from genetic patterns is actually a lot more difficult than it's generally represented in the media. Very commonly, different data sets will give you different narrative stories of origin. Different analysis of the same data, sometimes, will give you different stories as well.

It seems absurd to say there's no correlation between race and athletic ability.</p>"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>The way the question is phrased really embodies the key issue of scientific discourse: What's the relationship between a body of data and the conclusions one can draw from the data? I think we have to start off first by asking exactly what do we mean by athleticism. Because obviously a lot of diverse characteristics go into that - strength, flexibility, coordination, eyesight, endurance, just to name a few. But, obviously, very different kinds of talents are required in athletes. I happen to have seen a lot of white guys who jump quite well. They're all in ballet, not in basketball. But, one of the questions is what kinds of common sense ideas are inflecting the way that the question is being asked. As opposed to a rigorous approach to it.</p>\n\n<p>If we take the sort of common sense idea that black people are faster than white people, what does that actually mean in a rigorous test? Does it mean that all blacks are faster than all whites? Well, that's demonstrably false. Does it mean a hypothetical average black person is faster than a hypothetical black person? Well, that's meaningless because I don't know how you'd find the hypothetical average person. Does it mean the ten fastest black people are faster than the ten fastest black people? This is, I think, close to what people mean when they say something like that. But the problem with that, is it's statistically nonsensical to characterize a group of a couple of billion people by its most extreme members.</p>\n\n<p>What we're looking at here in the best athletes is essentially occupational overrepresentation. There are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to sports as a vocation. For example, in boxing, there's an overrepresentation of blacks. There's also an overrepresentation of Hispanics in boxing. It's a consequence of the opportunities open to the particular group in question. And where most avenues to upward mobility are closed to you, you're going to gravitate to something that seems just as low a probability of success as anything else. If other venues are open to you, that don't involve getting beaten up on a regular basis, you're probably more likely to take those.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at the general issue of occupational overrepresentation, as evidence of genetic superiority, we're kind of left with the promise of Irish policeman yielding Irish police genes, and Jewish comedians being the result of Jewish comedy genes, and Chinese laundry genes, which, of course, is ridiculous. The point of all this is that there are a lot of reasons why people are attracted to certain professions and certain occupations and certain things to do with their lives. Only one of which is that they have some sort of natural ability for it.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point is that while we like to talk about ability, we have no real way of measuring it. It's a metaphysical, abstract quality. Ability is something you're born with that is independent of the development you will incur during your life. But the fact is, the only thing that we can measure is what you actually do, how you actually perform.
