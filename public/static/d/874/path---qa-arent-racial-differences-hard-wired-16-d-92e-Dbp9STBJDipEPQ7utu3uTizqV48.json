And one of the basic classifications is, are you member of my family - and family can be defined in any number of different ways - versus a non-member of my family. That's why anthropology starts off with a recognition that kinship structures social organizations. So, once you get beyond, \"Are you someone I can trust because you're in my family or are you someone I have to be suspicious of because I don't know that much about you,\" I don't think that there's any evidence at all that we're, in any sense, hard wired to trust, feel, or resent people who are from another race. Any more than we would distrust anyone who is from another religion, or dressed funny, or blows their nose too much.</p>\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is that the whole idea of categorizing people into a small number of discreet geographical groups is very strongly located in time and space to 17th-century Europe. Prior to that time, as far as we can tell, Europeans and anyone else who was interested in the global distribution of variation simply classified people on the basis of local variation, not global, geo-continental variation.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>I do not know of any data on this topic; however, it seems counterintuitive to me that humans would be hard-wired to focus on racial differences. Most of our evolution as a species took place in Africa. And during most of that time, people probably were not in contact with people who appeared extremely different from themselves. The morphological differences that we consider to be racial differences were not the kinds of differences that people were routinely exposed to. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that we would have evolved some innate focus on racial differences. On the other hand, there is a lot of evidence that we make very fine distinctions between, for instance, peoples of the Middle East or different tribal groups of the same race. People often perceive \"awful otherness\" in groups who look like themselves but who have different cultural practices or religious traditions. It's certainly not the case that human beings are inclined to be more friendly or accepting towards those we perceive as members of our same race.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Alan Goodman"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"Pilar Ossorio"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>The ancient Greek Herodotus says that the Ethiopians are the most beautiful people in the world.
