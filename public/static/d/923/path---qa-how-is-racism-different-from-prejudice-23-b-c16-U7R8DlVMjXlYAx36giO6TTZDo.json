But racism is based on the assumption that race is an indicator of basic traits of character. That is, if you know a person's race, you can say a lot more than simply what race the person is. Presumably, you can say how the person might think, how the person might react, his inclination, his physical abilities, all those kinds of things. And of course, you can't do anything about your race. You are whatever race you are judged to be. Once society makes the construction, constructs race, you are a certain race depending upon certain physical, outwardly observable characteristics.

Not only are laypersons confused, but scientists and doctors are also confused, and they make critical decisions based on what they think race is. The bottom line is that race was once thought to explain most human variation in genetics and biology. However, like the idea that the earth is flat, this notion of race has not stood the test of time. Human biological variation is remarkably complex and fascinating. It is best described in ways that capture this complexity. The idea of race, that humans are lumped into a finite number of groups, does not do the job. On the other hand, racializing and racisms have potentially dire health and medical consequences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThankfully, the old notion of race as inherent biology has been disproved, making it more apparent that racial differences in health must be due to myriad differences in life experience. We need to do an even better job of understanding how what we gloss as race relates to medical care and health. We can no longer take the shortcut of assuming that skin color provides deeper genetic meanings. I predict that the greatest understanding of health will come from going beyond assigning race in a haphazard manner to probing life experiences that may relate to the lived experience of being perceived and self perceived as a member of one or more races.

Not only are laypersons confused, but scientists and doctors are also confused, and they make critical decisions based on what they think race is. The bottom line is that race was once thought to explain most human variation in genetics and biology. However, like the idea that the earth is flat, this notion of race has not stood the test of time. Human biological variation is remarkably complex and fascinating. It is best described in ways that capture this complexity. The idea of race, that humans are lumped into a finite number of groups, does not do the job. On the other hand, racializing and racisms have potentially dire health and medical consequences.<br /><br />\nThankfully, the old notion of race as inherent biology has been disproved, making it more apparent that racial differences in health must be due to myriad differences in life experience. We need to do an even better job of understanding how what we gloss as race relates to medical care and health. We can no longer take the shortcut of assuming that skin color provides deeper genetic meanings.
