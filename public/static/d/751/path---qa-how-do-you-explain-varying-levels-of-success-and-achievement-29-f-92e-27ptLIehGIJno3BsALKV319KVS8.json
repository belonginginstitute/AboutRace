This seems to correlate with race or the way people look. What's your take?</p>"},"field_expert_1":{"processed":"<p>I think there are several faulty leaps of logic here. First, there's no environmental control that makes people comparable. Individuals aren't in equal environments, or on equal footing, leaving the starting gate at the same time. And without at least some crude approximation of that, it's extremely hard to make all of these assumptions about what group outperforms another group. It's also not true to fact. Not true if one looks at this more historically. The data really don't quite fit the assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that there is no there there when we look at races. All we see when we look at races, genetically, is an incredible amount of variation within so-called races. So, to try to make any judgments about one group versus another is extremely difficult when variation is the rule of the game. Abilities change through time. Performance as we see it on the human stage changes through time.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the most important thing to say is that all of this assumes that race is a valid, analytical category. But, in fact, it really isn't a valid, analytical category. Science strives for generalizability. It wants a truth to look for, truths that are true not just for a specific study, but across time, across space. But, as we've previously discussed, race is a category without any sort of central tendency to it. It's a category that is always open to social definition. Always changing through time and place. Who biologically is in a particular race changes over time and over place.</p>\n\n<p>I think the right question to be asking is, what provides for the opportunity of one group or another? We should not assume that perceivable differences are due to genetics. I hope we wouldn't assume today that basic differences in infant mortality between whites and blacks are due to some sort of inherent differences between those two groups that I've just defined by color. Instead, we should look at, what are the social, economic, and political processes that might explain why, at this point and time in the United States, we see such glaring differences in infant mortality between blacks and whites.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":null,"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_expert_3_name":null,"field_expert_4_name":null,"field_expert_4_answer":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"1cbd6741-7d9e-4f4a-b981-ab82026f7a1c"}}
